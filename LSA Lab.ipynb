calculations on a\\\\n\"grand tour\" space probe launched by a saturn v in 1975-76. at the time,i felt \\\\nthat\\\\nthe idea of a big \"mother ship\" had some merit - the voyagers had to be rather\\\\nsmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak titan\\\\niii/centaur launchers. the concept i examined (and michael\\\\\\'s?) had a lot in\\\\ncommon with the british interplanetary society\\\\\\'s daedalus project for sending a\\\\nprobe to barnard\\\\\\'s star - i.e. a large \"bus\" spacecraft carrying several\\\\nsmaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.\\\\nthe saturn v supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards\\\\njupiter and beyond. the \"bus\" could have included far more powerful\\\\ncameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power\\\\nsource than the voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.\\\\nextremely important as the voyagers had to perform most of their measurements\\\\nwithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a\\\\nrelatively great distance.\\\\n---\\\\nthe smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the \"real\" voyagers,\\\\nand an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards pluto in\\\\nthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during\\\\nthe mission. the advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the\\\\nsame basic jupiter-saturn-uranus-neptune mission than voyager 2 did, but in\\\\naddition two \"sub-probes\" could have been relased at saturn, examining\\\\nthat planet\\\\\\'s south polar regions before moving on to pluto. this would have\\\\nenabled nasa to map both hemispheres of pluto/charon by 1986...and several\\\\nother probes could have examined parts of the jupiter/saturn/uranus/neptune\\\\nsystems that weren\\\\\\'t examined in great detail by the voyagers due to\\\\ntrajectory-related factors. a small \"swarm\" of camera-equipped miniature space\\\\nprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a \\\\nsmall voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, \\\\nwell-equipped spacecraft. and would we have learned a lot more about the outer\\\\nplanets! the reason why the grand tour was cancelled was lack of money, of\\\\ncourse. \\\\n\\\\nmarcu$\\\\n   \\\\n> ==\\\\n> michael adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- i\\\\\\'m not high, just jacked\\\\n> \\\\n\\', \\'from:

abstract of that paper.\\\\n\\\\n   the currently favored explanation for the origin of \\\\\\\\grbs puts them\\\\n   at cosmological distances;\\\\n   but as long as there is no distance\\\\n   indicator to these events all possible sources which are\\\\n   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. this is\\\\n   why the oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,\\\\n   although there is no known mechanism for generating \\\\\\\\grbs\\\\n   from cometary nuclei. unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \\\\\\\\grbs\\\\n   originate in the solar cometary cloud\\\\n   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.\\\\n\\\\n   we use the available data on the distribution of \\\\\\\\grbs (the batse\\\\n   catalogue up to march, 1992), and\\\\n   the catalogue of cometary orbits  by marsden and williams (1992) to\\\\n   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations\\\\n   between the angular distributions of \\\\\\\\grbs and comets\\\\\\' aphelia,\\\\n   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,\\\\n   at least to some extent, true variations\\\\n   in the column density of the oort cloud. we also apply the $\\\\\\\\vov$\\\\n   test to both distributions.\\\\n\\\\n   we have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a kolmogorov-smirnov\\\\n   test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a\\\\n   $\\\\\\\\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-d\\\\n   cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for\\\\n   isolating the effect of possible observational biases.\\\\n   these tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but\\\\n   the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any\\\\n   connection with complete confidence. we performed monte-carlo simulations\\\\n   which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\\\\\\\\sim 800$\\\\n   it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.\\\\n   currently,\\\\n    it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement\\\\n   found for the $\\\\\\\\vov$ parameter which makes the oort\\\\n   cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \\\\\\\\grbs.\\\\n\\', \\'from: wawers@lif.de (theo wawers)\\\\nsubject: re: sunrise/ sunset times\\\\norganization: lahmeyer international,

agencies\\\\n\\\\nby ed mcnevin\\\\n     members of jpl\\\\\\'s space very long baseline interferometry\\\\n(vlbi) project team recently concluded a week-long series of\\\\nmeetings with officials from russia and japan.\\\\n     the meetings were part of \"space vlbi week\" held at jpl in\\\\nearly march and were intended to maintain cooperation between\\\\ninternational space agencies participating in the development of\\\\nthe u.s. space vlbi project, a recently approved jpl flight\\\\nproject set for launch in 1995.\\\\n     u.s. space vlbi will utilize two earth-orbiting spacecraft\\\\n-- the japanese vsop (vlbi space observing program) satellite\\\\nwith its 8-meter radio telescope, and a russian radioastron\\\\n10-meter satellite. both spacecraft will team up with\\\\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\\\\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\\\\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\\\\n     japan\\\\\\'s vsop satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\\\\nconduct imaging science, while the russian radioastron spacecraft\\\\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour earth orbit to conduct exploratory\\\\nradio astronomy. each satellite will point at a source target for\\\\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\\\\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\\\\nwhile within view on earth.\\\\n     according to dr. joel smith, jpl\\\\\\'s project manager for the\\\\nu.s. space vlbi, meetings like those held at jpl will permit\\\\njapan and russia, who have little previous experience in radio\\\\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\\\\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\\\\nobservations required by the space vlbi project.\\\\n     \"one of our main activities is developing the methodology\\\\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\\\\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\\\\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\\\\ncelestial objects,\" said smith.\\\\n     three new tracking antennas are being built at dsn\\\\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\\\\njapan, russia and green bank, w.va. this global network of\\\\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\\\\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\\\\ninformation to a correlator located at the national radio\\\\nastronomy observatory in socorro, n.m. the correlator will\\\\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\\\\ninvestigators in moscow, tokyo, and jpl via electronic mail.\\\\n     smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\\\\nby the space vlbi network will provide radio astronomers with\\\\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\\\\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\\\\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\\\\n     \"there is a long history of radio astronomy using\\\\nground-based telescopes,\" said smith. \"what we intend to do is to\\\\nextend radio astronomy into earth orbit. our goal is to look\\\\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\\\\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\\\\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy.\"\\\\n     smith noted that if one examines \"the active galactic\\\\nnuclei, you\\\\\\'ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\\\\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\\\\nthan you would expect.\"\\\\n     he said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\\\\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\\\\nthe jets. smith hopes that \"by using space vlbi to look further\\\\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved.\"\\\\n     russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\\\\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the united states, and\\\\njapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\\\\nyear. analysis of this hardware will permit u.s. scientists and\\\\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed vlba\\\\ncorrelator operating at the nrao in order to accommodate the odd\\\\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\\\\nground-based radio telescopes involved in space vlbi.\\\\n     smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\\\\njapanese and russian space agency officials -- like those held at\\\\njpl in march -- have proceeded smoothly. yet he knows that the\\\\npolitical uncertainty in russia could jeopardize that country\\\\\\'s\\\\nparticipation in the project.\\\\n     \"nothing is ever smooth,\" he said, \"but the russians have\\\\nbeen incredibly open with us. we always anticipated some\\\\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\\\\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\\\\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\\\\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level.\"\\\\n     smith points out that the japanese space agency has more at\\\\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\\\\nscience mission.\\\\n     \"the japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\\\\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,\"\\\\nhe said.\\\\n     but smith also noted that japanese space agency officials\\\\nlook at the u.s. space vlbi mission as an opportunity to showcase\\\\nthe technology involved with vsop spacecraft, and their highly\\\\nregarded mach v launch vehicle.\\\\n     yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\\\\nambitious project, jpl\\\\\\'s smith is satisfied that planning for the\\\\nspace vlbi project is beyond the significant financial and\\\\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\\\\n     \"fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\\\\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\\\\nother. by themselves, both spacecraft are independent,\\\\nscientifically exciting missions.\"\\\\n                           ###\\\\n     ___    _____     ___\\\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\\\\\  /_ /|     ron baalke         |

orientation) is a dollar not\\\\nspent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  in order to turn the\\\\nspacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the ops guys will be\\\\navailable, or you need to retrain a new team.\\\\n\\\\nhaving said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.\\\\nmany of the operational satellites goddard flies (like the tiros noaa \\\\nseries) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.\\\\nextras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a \"standby\" mode for\\\\nuse in an emergency.  in that case, however, the same ops team is still\\\\nrequired to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is\\\\nrelatively cheap.\\\\n\\\\nfinally, pat\\\\\\'s explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance\\\\nto stay under control) is also right on the mark.  i suggested a spin-\\\\nstabilized control mode because it would require little power or \\\\nmaintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time\\\\nto time.\\\\n\\\\nin the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),\\\\nbut there is some technical rationale behind the

some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\"  \"so\\\\nwhat if i stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\"  besides that, i\\\\nthink it\\\\\\'s still open to interpretation

heat \\\\nsink capacity could offer some military utility for \"high ground\" military\\\\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. if space \\\\ntravel becomes cheap enough, it

factories\\\\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of g look much better. luna\\\\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\\\\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. luna offers\\\\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\\\\nand shielding. the asteroids and comets offer sources of both light

activist\",\\\\nallen sherzer & tim kyger write:\\\\n  \"another problem is what are called \\\\\\'wraps\\\\\\' (or sometimes\\\\n   the \\\\\\'center tax\\\\\\'). when work for a large program like\\\\n   freedom or shuttle is performed at a nasa center, the\\\\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\\\\n   to a slush fund. this money is used to fund work the\\\\n   center manager wants to fund. this sum is estimated to\\\\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. think about\\\\n   that: of the $30 billion cost of freedom, fully $10\\\\n   billion won\\\\\\'t be spent on anything having anything\\\\n   to do with space stations! now, maybe that $10 billion\\\\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\\\\\\'t), but the work done\\\\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\\\\n   the cost of other projects. congress has no idea of the\\\\n   existense of these wraps; congress has never heard the\\\\n   term \\\\\\'center tax\\\\\\'. they look at the station they are\\\\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\\\\n   it doesn\\\\\\'t add up. they wonder this blissfully unaware\\\\n   that a third of the money is going for something else.\"\\\\n\\\\nmy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. a couple\\\\nof weeks ago, when i first read this in your posting, i\\\\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in space station\\\\nat headquarters [if you wondering why i didn\\\\\\'t post a\\\\nresponse immediately, i do have a real job i\\\\\\'m supposed\\\\nto be doing here at headquarters, & digging up old 20 khz\\\\ndata & looking into sherzer/kyger claims rates pretty low\\\\non the totem pole of priority. also, i spent last weekend\\\\nin kansas city, at the national science teachers \\\\nassociation conference, extolling the virtues of ssf\\\\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\\\\n\\\\nfirst off, yes, the concept of \\\\\\'center tax\\\\\\', or \\\\\\'wrap\\\\\\' does\\\\nexist. if i recall the numbers correctly, the total \\\\\\'tax\\\\\\'\\\\nfor the ssf program for this fiscal year is around $40 million.\\\\nthis was computed by adding up the wp-1, wp-2, and wp-4\\\\ncenter \\\\\\'taxes\\\\\\'. with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at\\\\n$2.2 billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\\\\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\\\\n\\\\nover the life of the ssf program, using your figure of $30\\\\nbillion for the cost of ssf, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\\\\n$540 million. this is alot less than $10 billion, but i\\\\nwill concede it\\\\\\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket\\\\nchange.\\\\n\\\\ni should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\\\\nbe close to the actual rate. the tax is only charged on funds\\\\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like mcdonalds at some\\\\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\\\\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don\\\\\\'t if you get it\\\\ntake-out). for example, at wp-4, the vast bulk of the funds\\\\nwe receive go to the rocketdyne contract, and are *not*\\\\nsubject to the center tax (i don\\\\\\'t have the numbers in\\\\nfront of me, but i\\\\\\'d guess at least 95% of the wp-4 funds\\\\ngo to rocketdyne). so, you could be right about a tax\\\\nrate of 1/3, but it\\\\\\'s only applied to funds spent at the\\\\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\\\\n\\\\nthis leads to the obvious question \"what is the government\\\\ndoing with ssf funds that don\\\\\\'t go to the prime contractors?\\\\n(i.e. ok, wp-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. a\\\\nbig portion of this slice goes to rocketdyne. what happens\\\\nto the balance of the funds, which aren\\\\\\'t eaten\\\\nup by the center tax?)\"\\\\n\\\\nat wp-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\\\\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\\\\nwork done by rocketdyne). we have used these funds to\\\\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\\\\npower system architecture. our testbed has a real life\\\\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\\\\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\\\\n(to simulate the nickel-hydrogen batteries on ssf), dc\\\\nswitchgear, dc-dc converter units, and simulated\\\\nloads. data from the testbed was used in a recent\\\\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\\\\nof the power system.\\\\n\\\\nwe have also used the supporting development money to\\\\npurchase nickel hydrogen batteries, which are on life\\\\ntesting at both lewis and the crane naval facility in\\\\nindiana. as a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\\\\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\\\\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\\\\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\\\\n\\\\nas a final example, my \\\\\\'home\\\\\\' division at lewis used\\\\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\\\\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\\\\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\\\\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\\\\nusing a monte-carlo simulation, setting up a \\\\ndatabase with information on weight of the power\\\\nsystem elements).\\\\n\\\\nfinally, the money raised by the \\\\\\'tax\\\\\\' does not all\\\\ngo into a \\\\\\'slush fund.\\\\\\' at lewis, the director\\\\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. each year,\\\\nany individual at lewis can submit a proposal to\\\\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\\\\nat pretty much anything within the lewis charter.\\\\n\\\\nmost of the tax, however, goes to fund the \\\\\\'general\\\\\\'\\\\nservices at the center, like the library, the \\\\ncentral computer services division, the contractor \\\\nwho removes the snow, etc. thus, it is rather\\\\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\\\\nssf budget doesn\\\\\\'t go for ssf activities. to get\\\\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\\\\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\\\\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\\\\nused to support ssf (which would be hard to\\\\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\\\\nwhat percentage of the bill for aviation week for\\\\n1 year is \\\\\\'billable\\\\\\' to ssf, would you base it on\\\\nthe person-hours ssf employees spend reading av-week\\\\nversus the rest of the center personnel). you would\\\\nthen have to compare this estimate of the ssf\\\\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\\\\nthe tax that goes to support the library. who knows,\\\\nmaybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library, but\\\\nwe underpay for snow removal? talk about\\\\na burecratic nightmare!\\\\n\\\\nmy last point is that i can\\\\\\'t believe your claim that\\\\ncongress has never heard of the term \\\\\\'center tax.\\\\\\'\\\\nunfortunately, all of the nasa testimony before\\\\ncongress isn\\\\\\'t on a computer, so i can\\\\\\'t do a simple\\\\nword search someplace to prove you wrong. but surely,\\\\nin some gao audit somewhere, these nasa cost methods\\\\nwere documented for congress?\\\\n\\', \\'from:

report the\\\\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\\\\nmeasure and study chemicals in the earth\\\\\\'s ozone layer.\\\\n\\\\n     the april 3 flight from california\\\\\\'s barstow/daggett airport\\\\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\\\\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\\\\nwith the upper atmosphere research satellite (uars).  \\\\n\\\\n     the data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\\\\nreadings from the atmospheric trace molecular spectroscopy\\\\n(atmos) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\\\\ndiscovery.\\\\n\\\\n     \"we launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\\\\nongoing ozone research program.  in fact, jpl is actively\\\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\\\nimportant ways,\" said dr. jim margitan, principal investigator on\\\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\\\n\\\\n     \"there are two jpl instruments on the uars satellite,\" he\\\\ncontinued.  \"the atmos experiment is conducted by jpl scientists,\\\\nand the jpl balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\\\nright.\"\\\\n\\\\n     the measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\\\nunderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\\\n\\\\n     the scientific balloon payload consisted of three jpl\\\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a fourier\\\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\\\n\\\\n     launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  data was radioed to ground\\\\nstations and recorded onboard.  the flight ended at 10 p.m.\\\\npacific time in eastern new mexico when the payload was commanded\\\\nto separate from the balloon.\\\\n\\\\n     \"we needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\\\nmeasurements,\" margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\\\n\\\\n     it will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  they will then forward\\\\ntheir data to the uars central data facility at the goddard space\\\\nflight center in greenbelt, maryland for use by the uars\\\\nscientists.    \\\\n\\\\n     the balloon was launched by the national scientific balloon\\\\nfacility, normally based in palestine, tex., operating under a\\\\ncontract from nasa\\\\\\'s wallops flight facility.  the balloon was\\\\nlaunched in california because of the west-to-east wind direction\\\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\\\n\\\\n     the balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  the balloons weigh\\\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  the\\\\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\\\\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\\\\n\\\\n     the jpl balloon research is sponsored by nasa\\\\\\'s upper\\\\natmosphere research program and the uars correlative measurements\\\\nprogram.

universe\"\\\\napril 23, 1993\\\\n\\\\ncosmologist stephen hawking tours lab\\\\n\\\\nby karre marino\\\\n     some 15 years after his first visit to jpl, prof. stephen\\\\nhawking, lucasian professor of mathematics at cambridge\\\\nuniversity and author of \"a brief history of time,\" returned to\\\\nthe lab april 5.\\\\n     on a tour hosted by jpl chief scientist dr. moustafa chahine\\\\nand merle mckenzie, manager of the international affairs office,\\\\nhawking visited a variety of facilities, met with lab director\\\\ndr. edward stone and various project scientists and managers, and\\\\nfelt \"like royalty,\" he said. hawking, whose theories attempt to\\\\nexplain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate\\\\ndimensions, wanted to re-visit jpl, he explained, \"because while\\\\ni\\\\\\'m most interested in those things in space that are farther\\\\naway, i know that here is where the first steps are taken.\"\\\\n     hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate\\\\nstudents and his aides, began the tour in von karman auditorium,\\\\nas david evans, deputy assistant lab director in the office of\\\\nflight projects, and dr. arden albee, mars observer\\\\\\'s project\\\\nscientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.\\\\n     voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid\\\\nto a gold plate with a series of engraved images. should\\\\nextraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, evans noted,\\\\nthey would find a variety of images that would explain something\\\\nof earth. the professor asked if we were still communicating with\\\\nthe spacecraft, and evans affirmed that we are.\\\\n     using a model of mars observer, albee spent several minutes\\\\ndescribing the project and the spacecraft\\\\\\'s features. in answer\\\\nto a question from hawking, chahine described a proposed\\\\ndrag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, \"it\\\\\\'s only\\\\na concept.\" chahine, who had met hawking at caltech about five\\\\nyears before, described the professor as \"a living miracle of the\\\\npower of the brain. he\\\\\\'s miraculous, and he has such a good sense\\\\nof humor.\"\\\\n     the next stop, a demonstration on scientific data\\\\nvisualization in section 384\\\\\\'s digital image animation lab,\\\\nentertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles\\\\nto view 3-d images of mars. project scientist dr. eric de jong\\\\nshowed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been\\\\ndiscovered in orbit close to jupiter. hawking was curious about\\\\nits composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he\\\\nasked several questions on their interpretation.\\\\n     norman haynes, ald, office of telecommunications and data\\\\nacquisition, briefed the professor on the space flight operations\\\\nfacility, and then hawking spoke with stone.\\\\n     the day ended with two technical discussions of particular\\\\ninterest to the professor. technical group leader dr. frank\\\\nestabrook and senior research scientist hugo wahlquist described\\\\na three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.\\\\nthen planetary astronomer dr. richard terrile explained the\\\\nphilosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.\\\\n     the hawking party, which had been visiting southern\\\\ncalifornia for five weeks, was headquartered at caltech, and\\\\nplanned to leave for england within a few weeks after the lab\\\\ntour. upon departing, the cambridge-based scientist promised\\\\nchahine that he would return to jpl for another visit.\\\\n                          ###\\\\n     ___    _____     ___\\\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\\\\\  /_ /|     ron baalke

bug in\\\\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\\\\n    range safety officer destroyed it. although the bug is sometimes claimed\\\\n    to have been an incorrect fortran do statement, it was actually a\\\\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\\\\n    from the expression \"r-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\\\\n    of radius). this error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\\\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\\\\n\\\\n    mariner 2 became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december\\\\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that venus is a\\\\n    very hot (800 degrees fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees f.) world\\\\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\\\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\\\\n\\\\n    mariner 3, launched on november 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\\\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\\\n    space. unable to collect the sun\\\\\\'s energy for power from its solar\\\\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\\\n    solar orbit. it was intended for a mars flyby with mariner 4.\\\\n\\\\n    mariner 4, the sister probe to mariner 3, did reach mars in 1965 and\\\\n    took the first close-up images of the martian surface (22 in all) as it\\\\n    flew by the planet. the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\\\n    much thinner than previously thought. many scientists concluded from\\\\n    this preliminary scan that mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\\\\n    geological and biological sense.\\\\n\\\\n    mariner 5 was sent to venus in 1967. it reconfirmed the data on that\\\\n    planet collected five years earlier by mariner 2, plus the information\\\\n    that venus\\\\\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\\\n    that of earth\\\\\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\\\\n    of an ocean.\\\\n\\\\n    mariner 6 and 7 were sent to mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\\\n    done by mariner 4 four years earlier. however, they failed to take away\\\\n    the concept of mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\\\\n    measurements of mariner 4.\\\\n\\\\n    mariner 8 ended up in the atlantic ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\\\n    launcher autopilot failed.\\\\n\\\\n    mariner 9, the sister probe to mariner 8, became the first craft to\\\\n    orbit mars in 1971. it returned information on the red planet that no\\\\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the martian\\\\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\\\\n    flowed across the planet. the probe also took the first detailed closeup\\\\n    images of mars\\\\\\' two small moons, phobos and deimos.\\\\n\\\\n    mariner 10 used venus as a gravity assist to mercury in 1974. the probe\\\\n    did return the first close-up images of the venusian atmosphere in\\\\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\\\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\\\n    earth days. mariner 10 eventually made three flybys of mercury from 1974\\\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. the probe revealed\\\\n    mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\\\n    thought. this would seem to indicate that mercury has an iron core which\\\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    pioneer (moon, sun, venus, jupiter, and saturn flybys and orbiters)\\\\n\\\\n    pioneer 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\\\\n    the moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\\\n    new information on the area between earth and the moon, including new\\\\n    data on the van allen radiation belts circling earth. all three craft\\\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. pioneer 1 was launched on\\\\n    october 11, 1958, pioneer 2 on november 8, and pioneer 3 on december 6.\\\\n\\\\n    pioneer 4 was a moon probe which missed the moon and became the first\\\\n    u.s. spacecraft to orbit the sun in 1959. pioneer 5 was originally\\\\n    designed to flyby venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to\\\\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until mariner 2. pioneer 6\\\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: pioneer 6, 7,\\\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. pioneer e (would\\\\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\\\\n\\\\n    pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in 1973. pioneer\\\\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\\\\n    study saturn in 1979. both vehicles should continue to function through\\\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\\\\n    to do so.\\\\n\\\\n    pioneer venus 1 (1978) (also known as pioneer venus orbiter, or pioneer\\\\n    12) burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october 8, 1992. pvo made\\\\n    the first radar studies of the planet\\\\\\'s surface via probe. pioneer venus\\\\n    2 (also known as pioneer 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\\\n    in december of 1978. the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\\\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\\\n    surface. though none were expected to survive to the surface, the day\\\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\\\\n    its batteries failed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    ranger (lunar lander and impact missions)\\\\n\\\\n    ranger 1 and 2 were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series. they\\\\n    were meant for high earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\\\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\\\\n\\\\n    ranger 3, launched on january 26, 1962, was intended to land an\\\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the moon, but problems during the\\\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit.\\\\n    ranger 3 did try to take some images of the moon as it flew by, but the\\\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\\\\n\\\\n    ranger 4, launched april 23, 1962, had the same purpose as ranger 3, but\\\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\\\\n    the first u.s. probe to reach the moon, albeit without returning data.\\\\n\\\\n    ranger 5, launched october 18, 1962 and similar to ranger 3 and 4, lost\\\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon\\\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\\\\n\\\\n    ranger 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: they were to send\\\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\\\n    with the moon. ranger 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\\\n    did not operate. ranger 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\\\\n    u.s. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    lunar orbiter (lunar surface photography)\\\\n\\\\n    lunar orbiter 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the moon and image\\\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned apollo\\\\n    missions of 1969-1972. the probes also contributed greatly to our\\\\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\\\\n    all five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\\\\n    essentially successful in their missions. they were the first u.s.\\\\n    probes to orbit the moon. all los were eventually crashed into the lunar\\\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo missions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    surveyor (lunar soft landers)\\\\n\\\\n    the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar\\\\n    module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the\\\\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the moon was covered\\\\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\\\\n    vehicle). surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\\\\n\\\\n    only surveyor 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. the rest became the\\\\n    first u.s. probes to soft land on the moon, taking thousands of images\\\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. apollo 12 landed 600 feet from\\\\n    surveyor 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to earth. surveyor 7,\\\\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\\\\n    the tycho crater region in 1968.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    viking (mars orbiters and landers)\\\\n\\\\n    viking 1 was launched from cape canaveral, florida on august 20, 1975 on\\\\n    a titan 3e-centaur d1 rocket. the probe went into martian orbit on june\\\\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of chryse\\\\n    planitia on july 20, 1976. it soon began its programmed search for\\\\n    martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\\\\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\\\n    its surroundings. one thing scientists learned was that mars\\\\\\' sky was\\\\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\\\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\\\n    thin atmosphere). the lander set down among a field of red sand and\\\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\\\\n\\\\n    the viking 1 orbiter kept functioning until august 7, 1980, when it ran\\\\n    out of attitude-control propellant. the lander was switched into a\\\\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\\\\n    functioning through 1994; but after november 13, 1982, an errant command\\\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\\\n    further orders. communication was never regained again, despite the\\\\n    engineers\\\\\\' efforts through may of 1983.\\\\n\\\\n    an interesting side note: viking 1\\\\\\'s lander has been designated the\\\\n    thomas a. mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the\\\\n    lander imaging team. the national air and space museum in washington,\\\\n    d.c. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until\\\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\\\\n\\\\n    viking 2 was launched on september 9, 1975, and arrived in martian orbit\\\\n    on august 7, 1976. the lander touched down on september 3, 1976 in\\\\n    utopia planitia. it accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\\\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\\\\n    one marsquake. the orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\\\\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that july. the lander was shut\\\\n    down on april 12, 1980.\\\\n\\\\n    the orbits of both viking orbiters should decay around 2025.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    voyager (outer planet flybys)\\\\n\\\\n    voyager 1 was launched september 5, 1977, and flew past jupiter on march\\\\n    5, 1979 and by saturn on november 13, 1980. voyager 2 was launched\\\\n    august 20, 1977 (before voyager 1), and flew by jupiter on august 7,\\\\n    1979, by saturn on august 26, 1981, by uranus on january 24, 1986, and\\\\n    by neptune on august 8, 1989. voyager 2 took advantage of a rare\\\\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\\\n    outer planet. voyager 1 could, in principle, have headed towards pluto,\\\\n    but jpl opted for the sure thing of a titan close up.\\\\n\\\\n    between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\\\\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. voyager 1&2 discovered\\\\n    that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\\\\n    aurorae. three new satellites were discovered. two of the major\\\\n    surprises were that jupiter has rings and that io has active sulfurous\\\\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the jovian magnetosphere.\\\\n\\\\n    when the two probes reached saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\\\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\\\n    the rings stable. the weather was tame compared with jupiter: massive\\\\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\\\\n    is known). titan\\\\\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. mimas\\\\\\' appearance was\\\\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance.\\\\n    the big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. braids,\\\\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\\\\n\\\\n    voyager 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\\\\n    continued the mission to uranus and neptune. uranus itself was highly\\\\n    monochromatic in appearance. one oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\\\n    axis, giving uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. icy channels were found on\\\\n    ariel, and miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\\\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\\\\n\\\\n    in contrast to uranus, neptune was found to have rather active weather,\\\\n    including numerous cloud features. the ring arcs turned out to be bright\\\\n    patches on one ring. two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\\\\n    discovered. neptune\\\\\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. triton had a\\\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (what\\\\\\'s liquid at 38k?)\\\\n\\\\n    the two voyagers are expected to last for about two more decades. their\\\\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\\\n    beyond pluto. their next major scientific discovery should be the\\\\n    location of the heliopause.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsoviet planetary missions\\\\n\\\\n    since there have been so many soviet probes to the moon, venus, and\\\\n    mars, i will highlight only the primary missions:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    soviet lunar probes\\\\n\\\\n    luna 1 - lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed moon and became first\\\\n\\\\t     craft in solar orbit.\\\\n    luna 2 - first craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\\\\n    luna 3 - took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\\\\n    zond 3 - took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since luna 3. was\\\\n\\\\t     also a test for future mars missions.\\\\n    luna 9 - first probe to soft land on the moon in 1966, returned images\\\\n\\\\t     from surface.\\\\n    luna 10 - first probe to orbit the moon in 1966.\\\\n    luna 13 - second successful soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\\\\n    zond 5 - first successful circumlunar craft. zond 6 through 8\\\\n\\\\t     accomplished similar missions through 1970. the probes were\\\\n\\\\t     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting soyuz-type lunar vehicle.\\\\n    luna 16 - first probe to land on moon and return samples of lunar soil\\\\n\\\\t      to earth in 1970. luna 20 accomplished similar mission in\\\\n\\\\t      1972.\\\\n    luna 17 - delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the moon\\\\\\'s\\\\n\\\\t      surface, lunokhod 1, in 1970. a similar feat was accomplished\\\\n\\\\t      with luna 21/lunokhod 2 in 1973.\\\\n    luna 24 - last soviet lunar mission to date. returned soil samples in\\\\n\\\\t      1976.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    soviet venus probes\\\\n\\\\n    venera 1 - first acknowledged attempt at venus mission. transmissions\\\\n\\\\t       lost enroute in 1961.\\\\n    venera 2 - attempt to image venus during flyby mission in tandem with\\\\n\\\\t       venera 3. probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in\\\\n\\\\t       february of 1966. no images were returned.\\\\n    venera 3 - attempt to place a lander capsule on venusian surface.\\\\n\\\\t       transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\\\\n\\\\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\\\\n    venera 4 - first probe to successfully return data while descending\\\\n\\\\t       through venusian atmosphere. crushed by air pressure before\\\\n\\\\t       reaching surface in 1967. venera 5 and 6 mission profiles\\\\n\\\\t       similar in 1969.\\\\n    venera 7 - first probe to return data from the surface of another planet\\\\n\\\\t       in 1970. venera 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\\\\n\\\\t       1972.\\\\n    venera 9 - sent first image of venusian surface in 1975. was also the\\\\n\\\\t       first probe to orbit venus. venera 10 accomplished similar\\\\n\\\\t       mission.\\\\n    venera 13 - returned first color images of venusian surface in 1982.\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tvenera 14 accomplished similar mission.\\\\n    venera 15 - accomplished radar mapping with venera 16 of sections of\\\\n\\\\t\\\\tplanet\\\\\\'s surface in 1983 more detailed than pvo.\\\\n    vega 1 - accomplished with vega 2 first balloon probes of venusian\\\\n\\\\t     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. flyby buses went on\\\\n\\\\t     to become first spacecraft to study comet halley close-up in\\\\n\\\\t     march of 1986.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    soviet mars probes\\\\n\\\\n    mars 1 - first acknowledged mars probe in 1962. transmissions ceased\\\\n\\\\t     enroute the following year.\\\\n    zond 2 - first possible attempt to place a lander capsule on martian\\\\n\\\\t     surface. probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\\\\n    mars 2 - first soviet mars probe to land - albeit crash - on martian\\\\n\\\\t     surface. orbiter section first soviet probe to circle the red\\\\n\\\\t     planet in 1971.\\\\n    mars 3 - first successful soft landing on martian surface, but lander\\\\n\\\\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\\\\n    mars 4 - attempt at orbiting mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\\\\n\\\\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\\\\n    mars 5 - first fully successful soviet mars mission, orbiting mars in\\\\n\\\\t     1974. returned images of martian surface comparable to u.s.\\\\n\\\\t     probe mariner 9.\\\\n    mars 6 - landing attempt in 1974. lander crashed into the surface.\\\\n    mars 7 - lander missed mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\\\\n\\\\t     with its flyby bus.\\\\n    phobos 1 - first attempt to land probes on surface of mars\\\\\\' largest\\\\n\\\\t       moon, phobos. probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\\\\n\\\\t       human/computer error.\\\\n    phobos 2 - attempt to land probes on martian moon phobos. the probe did\\\\n\\\\t       enter mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\\\\n\\\\t       before scheduled phobos landing.\\\\n\\\\n    while there has been talk of soviet jupiter, saturn, and even\\\\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\\\\n    yet been taken with these projects. more intensive studies of the moon,\\\\n    mars, venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\\\\n    mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\\\\n    planned for 2003. how the many changes in the former soviet union (now\\\\n    the commonwealth of independent states) will affect the future of their\\\\n    space program remains to be seen.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\njapanese planetary missions\\\\n\\\\n    sakigake (ms-t5) was launched from the kagoshima space center by isas on\\\\n    january 8 1985, and approached halley\\\\\\'s comet within about 7 million km\\\\n    on march 11, 1986. the spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\\\\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\\\\n    which work normally now, so isas made an earth swingby by sakigake on\\\\n    january 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\\\\\'s. the closest\\\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (jst=utc+9h) on january 8, 1992. the\\\\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. this is the first planet-swingby for\\\\n    a japanese spacecraft.\\\\n\\\\n    during the approach, sakigake observed the geotail. some geotail\\\\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. the second earth-swingby\\\\n    will be on june 14, 1993 (at 40 re (earth\\\\\\'s radius)), and the third\\\\n    october 28, 1994 (at 86 re).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    hiten, a small lunar probe, was launched into earth orbit on january 24,\\\\n    1990. the spacecraft was then known as muses-a, but was renamed to hiten\\\\n    once in orbit. the 430 lb probe looped out from earth and made its first\\\\n    lunary flyby on march 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\\\n    satellite, hagoromo. japan at this point became the third nation to\\\\n    orbit a satellite around the moon, joining the unites states and ussr.\\\\n\\\\n    the smaller spacecraft, hagoromo, remained in orbit around the moon. an\\\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the japanese space scientists\\\\n    to lose track of it. hagoromo\\\\\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on march\\\\n    19, but the spacecraft\\\\\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. the\\\\n    rocket firing of hagoromo was optically confirmed using the schmidt\\\\n    camera (105-cm, f3.1) at the kiso observatory in japan.\\\\n\\\\n    hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\\\\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the earth\\\\\\'s atmosphere. hiten\\\\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 jst (utc+9h) on february 15,\\\\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\\\\\'s surface (35.3n, 9.7e) and\\\\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\\\\n    lunar orbit. the following is the orbital calculation results after the\\\\n    approach:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tapoapsis altitude: about 49,400 km\\\\n\\\\tperiapsis altitude: about 9,600 km\\\\n\\\\tinclination\\\\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\\\\n\\\\tperiod\\\\t\\\\t: 4.7 days\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nplanetary mission references\\\\n\\\\n    i also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\\\\n    groups: general overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\\\\n    and periodical sources on space probes. this list is by no means\\\\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\\\\n    research through generally available works on the subject. if anyone can\\\\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\\\\n\\\\n    though naturally i recommend all the books listed below, i think it\\\\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\\\\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\\\\n    this area. i also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\\\\n    general works on astronomy and the sol system, to give you some extra\\\\n    background. most of these books and periodicals can

periodicals:\\\\n\\\\n    nasa has published very detailed and technical books on every space\\\\n    probe mission it has launched. good university libraries will carry\\\\n    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission\\\\n    you wish to read about. i recommend these works after you first study\\\\n    some of the books listed above.\\\\n\\\\n    some periodicals i recommend for reading on space probes are national\\\\n    geographic, which has written articles on the pioneer probes to earth\\\\\\'s\\\\n    moon luna and the jovian planets jupiter and saturn, the ranger,\\\\n    surveyor, lunar orbiter, and apollo missions to luna, the mariner\\\\n    missions to mercury, venus, and mars, the viking probes to mars, and the\\\\n    voyager missions to jupiter, saturn, uranus, and neptune.\\\\n\\\\n    more details on american, soviet, european, and japanese probe missions\\\\n    can be found in sky and telescope, astronomy, science, nature, and\\\\n    scientific american magazines. time, newsweek, and various major\\\\n    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,\\\\n    but also show you what else was going on with earth at the time events\\\\n    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. space missions are\\\\n    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you\\\\n    probably know.\\\\n\\\\n    depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you\\\\n    might also wish to join the planetary society, one of the largest space\\\\n    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. their\\\\n    periodical, the planetary report, details the latest space probe\\\\n    missions. write to the planetary society, 65 north catalina avenue,\\\\n    pasadena, california 91106 usa.\\\\n\\\\n    good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. i\\\\n    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas\\\\n    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from\\\\n    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.\\\\n\\\\n    larry klaes

appeared to move among the stars. they called these\\\\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after roman\\\\ndeities -- jupiter, king of the gods; mars, the god of war;\\\\nmercury, messenger of the gods; venus, the god of love and\\\\nbeauty, and saturn, father of jupiter and god of agriculture. the\\\\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\\\\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\\\\n\\\\n     science flourished during the european renaissance.\\\\nfundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\\\\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the sun were\\\\ncalculated. in the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\\\\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\\\\ndiscoveries.\\\\n\\\\n     but the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\\\\nsolar system exploration. advancements in rocketry after world\\\\nwar ii enabled our machines to break the grip of earth\\\\\\'s gravity\\\\nand travel to the moon and to other planets.\\\\n\\\\n     the united states has sent automated spacecraft, then\\\\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the moon. our automated\\\\nmachines have orbited and landed on venus and mars; explored the\\\\nsun\\\\\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\\\\nwhile flying past mercury, jupiter, saturn, uranus and neptune.\\\\n\\\\n     these travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\\\\nunderstanding of the solar system. through the electronic sight\\\\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\\\\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\\\\nto earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\\\\nand dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\\\\n\\\\n     future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\\\\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\\\\nachievements of the 20th century.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nautomated spacecraft\\\\n\\\\n     the national aeronautics and space administration\\\\\\'s (nasa\\\\\\'s)\\\\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\\\\nshapes and sizes. while they are designed to fulfill separate and\\\\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\\\\n\\\\n     each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\\\\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\\\\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\\\\nas for processing data and communicating with earth.\\\\n\\\\n     electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\\\\ninstruments and systems. nasa uses both solar energy from arrays\\\\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\\\\nsolar system missions. rechargeable batteries are employed for\\\\nbackup and supplemental power.\\\\n\\\\n     imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\\\\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\\\\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\\\\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! to help\\\\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\\\\ncontrol spacecraft.\\\\n\\\\n     the thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\\\\nconstant gaze at selected stars. just as earth\\\\\\'s early seafarers\\\\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\\\\nmaintain their bearings in space. with the subsystem locked onto\\\\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\\\\nspacecraft\\\\\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\\\\nand the craft\\\\\\'s communications antennas pointed toward earth. the\\\\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\\\\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\\\\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\\\\n\\\\n     between 1959 and 1971, nasa spacecraft were dispatched to\\\\nstudy the moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\\\\ninner planets other than earth -- mercury, venus and mars. these\\\\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\\\\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\\\\n\\\\n     for the early planetary reconnaissance missions, nasa\\\\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\\\\nmariners. their flights helped shape the planning of later\\\\nmissions. between 1962 and 1975, seven mariner missions conducted\\\\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\\\\n\\\\n     all of the mariners used solar panels as their primary power\\\\nsource. the first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\\\\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. other mariners were\\\\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\\\\nbodies.\\\\n\\\\n     although the mariners ranged from the mariner 2 venus\\\\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\\\\nmariner 9 mars orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\\\\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\\\\nprogram. the mariner 5 venus spacecraft, for example, had\\\\noriginally been a backup for the mariner 4 mars flyby. the\\\\nmariner 10 spacecraft sent to venus and mercury used components\\\\nleft over from the mariner 9 mars orbiter program.\\\\n\\\\n     in 1972, nasa launched pioneer 10, a jupiter spacecraft.\\\\ninterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- jupiter,\\\\nsaturn, uranus and neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\\\\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\\\\n\\\\n     four nasa spacecraft in all -- two pioneers and two voyagers\\\\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\\\\nsystem. because of the distances involved, these travelers took\\\\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\\\\nbarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\\\\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. because the sun\\\\\\'s\\\\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\\\\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\\\\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\\\\n\\\\n     nasa also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\\\\nour neighbors mars and venus in the middle and late 1970s. twin\\\\nviking landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\\\\nstations and as biology laboratories. two advanced orbiters --\\\\ndescendants of the mariner craft -- carried the viking landers\\\\nfrom earth and then studied martian features from above.\\\\n\\\\n     two drum-shaped pioneer spacecraft visited venus in 1978.\\\\nthe pioneer venus orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\\\\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\\\\\'s dense cloud cover\\\\nto study surface features. the pioneer venus multiprobe carried\\\\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. the probes and\\\\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\\\\nradioed information about the planet\\\\\\'s atmosphere during their\\\\ndescent toward the surface.\\\\n\\\\n     a new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\\\\nmagellan, galileo, ulysses, mars observer, the comet\\\\nrendezvous/asteroid flyby (craf) and cassini -- is being\\\\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\\\\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\\\\nneighborhood and our own planet.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nthe sun\\\\n\\\\n     a discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\\\\nwith the sun. the sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\\\\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\\\\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\\\\nto only about 0.14 percent. this 0.14 percent represents the\\\\nmaterial left over from the sun\\\\\\'s formation. one hundred and nine\\\\nearths would be required to fit across the sun\\\\\\'s disk, and its\\\\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million earths.\\\\n\\\\n     as a star, the sun generates energy through the process of\\\\nfusion. the temperature at the sun\\\\\\'s core is 15 million degrees\\\\ncelsius (27 million degrees fahrenheit), and the pressure there\\\\nis 340 billion times earth\\\\\\'s air pressure at sea level. the sun\\\\\\'s\\\\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees celsius (10,000 degrees\\\\nfahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\\\\nat the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\\\\nenergy. the sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\\\\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\\\\n\\\\n     the sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\\\\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\\\\nso. at the end of its life, the sun will start to fuse helium\\\\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\\\\nso large that it will swallow earth. after a billion years as a\\\\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\\\\nthe final end product of a star like ours. it may take a trillion\\\\nyears to cool off completely.\\\\n\\\\n     many spacecraft have explored the sun\\\\\\'s environment, but\\\\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\\\\ntwo-thirds of the distance from earth to the sun. pioneers 5-11,\\\\nthe pioneer venus orbiter, voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\\\\nhave all sampled the solar environment. the ulysses spacecraft,\\\\nlaunched on october 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of nasa and\\\\nthe european space agency. after using jupiter\\\\\\'s gravity to\\\\nchange its trajectory, ulysses will fly over the sun\\\\\\'s polar\\\\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\\\\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\\\\n\\\\n     we are fortunate that the sun is exactly the way it is. if\\\\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\\\\nnever have developed on earth.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nmercury\\\\n\\\\n     obtaining the first close-up views of mercury was the\\\\nprimary objective of the mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\\\\nnovember 3, 1973, from kennedy space center in florida. after a\\\\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of venus,\\\\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\\\\nsolar system\\\\\\'s innermost planet on march 29, 1974.\\\\n\\\\n     until mariner 10, little was known about mercury. even the\\\\nbest telescopic views from earth showed mercury as an indistinct\\\\nobject lacking any surface detail. the planet is so close to the\\\\nsun that it is usually lost in solar glare. when the planet is\\\\nvisible on earth\\\\\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\\\\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. only radar\\\\ntelescopes gave any hint of mercury\\\\\\'s surface conditions prior to\\\\nthe voyage of mariner 10.\\\\n\\\\n     the photographs mariner 10 radioed back to earth revealed an\\\\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\\\\nmoon. the pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\\\\nplanet. these apparently were created when mercury\\\\\\'s interior\\\\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\\\\\'s crust. the cliffs are as\\\\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\\\\nmiles).\\\\n\\\\n     instruments on mariner 10 discovered that mercury has a weak\\\\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\\\\ndensity of earth\\\\\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\\\\nand helium. when the planet\\\\\\'s orbit takes it closest to the sun,\\\\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees celsius (872 degrees\\\\nfahrenheit) on mercury\\\\\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees celsius\\\\n(-298 degrees fahrenheit) on the dark side. this range in surface\\\\ntemperature -- 650 degrees celsius (1,170 degrees fahrenheit) --\\\\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. mercury\\\\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\\\\n\\\\n     days and nights are long on mercury. the combination of a\\\\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 earth days) and a rapid\\\\nrevolution around the sun (88 earth days) means that one mercury\\\\nsolar day takes 176 earth days or two mercury years -- the time\\\\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\\\\nsun! \\\\n\\\\n     mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\\\\nthat of earth. scientists believe mercury has a heavy iron-rich\\\\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. that would\\\\nmake mercury\\\\\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the moon\\\\\\'s core\\\\nor those of any of the planets.\\\\n\\\\n     after the initial mercury encounter, mariner 10 made two\\\\nadditional flybys -- on september 21, 1974, and march 16, 1975 --\\\\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\\\\nand the mission was concluded. each flyby took place at the same\\\\nlocal mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\\\\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\\\\nplanet\\\\\\'s surface.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nvenus\\\\n\\\\n     veiled by dense cloud cover, venus -- our nearest planetary\\\\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. the mariner 2\\\\nspacecraft, launched on august 27, 1962, was the first of more\\\\nthan a dozen successful american and soviet missions to study the\\\\nmysterious planet. as spacecraft flew by or orbited venus,\\\\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on venus\\\\\\' surface,\\\\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\\\\nrest.\\\\n\\\\n     on december 14, 1962, mariner 2 passed within 34,839\\\\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of venus and became the first\\\\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\\\\nvenus for 42 minutes. mariner 5, launched in june 1967, flew much\\\\ncloser to the planet. passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\\\\nmiles) of venus on the second american flyby, mariner 5\\\\\\'s\\\\ninstruments measured the planet\\\\\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\\\\nradiation belts and temperatures. on its way to mercury, mariner\\\\n10 flew by venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to earth\\\\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the venusian atmosphere.\\\\n\\\\n     in the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\\\\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of venus. on december 4\\\\nof the same year, the pioneer venus orbiter became the first\\\\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\\\\n\\\\n     five days later, the five separate components making up the\\\\nsecond spacecraft -- the pioneer venus multiprobe -- entered the\\\\nvenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. the\\\\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\\\\natmospheric data back to earth during their descent toward the\\\\nsurface. although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\\\\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\\\\ntransmit data for another hour.\\\\n\\\\n     venus resembles earth in size, physical composition and\\\\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. however,\\\\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. for\\\\nexample, venus\\\\\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\\\\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of earth and most of the other\\\\nplanets.\\\\n\\\\n     approximately 96.5 percent of venus\\\\\\' atmosphere (95 times as\\\\ndense as earth\\\\\\'s) is carbon dioxide. the principal constituent of\\\\nearth\\\\\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. venus\\\\\\' atmosphere acts like a\\\\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\\\\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\\\\nspace. as a result, the planet\\\\\\'s average surface temperature is\\\\n482 degrees celsius (900 degrees fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\\\\nlead.\\\\n\\\\n     a radio altimeter on the pioneer venus orbiter provided the\\\\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\\\\\\'s dense cloud cover and\\\\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\\\\nnasa\\\\\\'s magellan spacecraft, launched on may 5, 1989, has been in\\\\norbit around venus since august 10, 1990. the spacecraft uses\\\\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\\\\nof the surface.\\\\n\\\\n     magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\\\\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. huge areas of the surface\\\\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\\\\nlying on top of previous ones. an elevated region named ishtar\\\\nterra is a lava-filled basin as large as the united states. at\\\\none end of this plateau sits maxwell montes, a mountain the size\\\\nof mount everest. scarring the mountain\\\\\\'s flank is a\\\\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\\\\nimpact crater named cleopatra. (almost all features on venus are\\\\nnamed for women; maxwell montes, alpha regio and beta regio are\\\\nthe exceptions.) craters survive on venus for perhaps 400 million\\\\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\\\\n\\\\n     extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\\\\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\\\\non earth. but on venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\\\\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\\\\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\\\\nthe san andreas fault in california.\\\\n\\\\n     venus\\\\\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\\\\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. at\\\\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\\\\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four earth days. the\\\\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as venus\\\\\\'\\\\nslow rotation of 243 earth days, whereas earth\\\\\\'s winds blow in\\\\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\\\\nalternating bands. venus\\\\\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\\\\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nearth\\\\n\\\\n     as viewed from space, our world\\\\\\'s distinguishing\\\\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\\\\nand white clouds. we are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\\\\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\\\\nconstituents. the only planet in the solar system known to harbor\\\\nlife, earth orbits the sun at an average distance of 150 million\\\\nkilometers (93 million miles). earth is the third planet from the\\\\nsun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\\\\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of venus.\\\\n\\\\n     our planet\\\\\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\\\\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\\\\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\\\\ncoming from the sun and other stars. earth\\\\\\'s atmosphere protects\\\\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\\\\nstrike the surface. active geological processes have left no\\\\nevidence of the pelting earth almost certainly received soon\\\\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. along with the\\\\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\\\\nthe early days of the solar system.\\\\n\\\\n     from our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\\\\nhome planet. the first american satellite -- explorer 1 -- was\\\\nlaunched from cape canaveral in florida on january 31, 1958, and\\\\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the van allen\\\\nradiation belts, surrounding earth.\\\\n\\\\n     since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\\\\nplanet\\\\\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\\\\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\\\\nejected from the sun. we\\\\\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\\\\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. and we now\\\\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\\\\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\\\\ncontracting by night. affected by changes in solar activity, the\\\\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on earth.\\\\n\\\\n     besides affecting earth\\\\\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\\\\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. when charged\\\\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in earth\\\\\\'s magnetic\\\\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\\\\\'s\\\\nmagnetic poles. these air molecules then begin to glow and are\\\\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\\\\n\\\\n     satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\\\\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. these\\\\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. continuous\\\\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\\\\ncontributes to a better understanding of earth\\\\\\'s complex weather\\\\nsystems.\\\\n\\\\n     from their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\\\\nearth\\\\\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\\\\\'s\\\\nhealth. these eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\\\\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\\\\nplanet in dangerous ways.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nthe moon\\\\n\\\\n     the moon is earth\\\\\\'s single natural satellite. the first\\\\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by american\\\\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\\\\ncompanion. in preparation for the human-crewed apollo\\\\nexpeditions, nasa dispatched the automated ranger, surveyor and\\\\nlunar orbiter spacecraft to study the moon between 1964 and 1968.\\\\n\\\\n     nasa\\\\\\'s apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\\\\nand data. six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\\\\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\\\\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\\\\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\\\\n\\\\n     from this material and other studies, scientists have\\\\nconstructed a history of the moon that includes its infancy.\\\\nrocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\\\\nbillion years old. the first few million years of the moon\\\\\\'s\\\\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\\\\nas a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\\\\ndifferent kinds of rock, the moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\\\\nand smaller objects. some of the asteroids were as large as rhode\\\\nisland or delaware, and their collisions with the moon created\\\\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\\\\n\\\\n     this catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\\\\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\\\\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\\\\nrock. heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\\\\nmelt the interior of the moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\\\\n(125 miles) below the surface. then, for the next 700 million\\\\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\\\\nfrom inside the moon. the lava gradually spread out over the\\\\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\\\\nthat galileo galilei, an astronomer of the italian renaissance,\\\\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\\\\n\\\\n     as far as we can tell, there has been no significant\\\\nvolcanic activity on the moon for more than three billion years.\\\\nsince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\\\\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the sun and stars,\\\\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\\\\nastronauts. if our astronauts had landed on the moon a billion\\\\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\\\\none today. thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\\\\napollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\\\\n\\\\n     the origin of the moon is still a mystery. four theories\\\\nattempt an explanation: the moon formed near earth as a separate\\\\nbody; it was torn from earth; it formed somewhere else and was\\\\ncaptured by our planet\\\\\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\\\\ncollision between earth and an asteroid about the size of mars.\\\\nthe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nmars\\\\n\\\\n     of all the planets, mars has long been considered the solar\\\\nsystem\\\\\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\\\\nastronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\\\\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. these\\\\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\\\\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\\\\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. in 1938, when orson\\\\nwelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\\\\nclassic war of the worlds  by h.g. wells, enough people believed\\\\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\\\\n\\\\n     another reason for scientists to expect life on mars had to\\\\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\\\\\'s\\\\nsurface. this phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\\\\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\\\\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\\\\n\\\\n     so far, six american missions to mars have been carried out.\\\\nfour mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\\\\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\\\\nbefore the viking orbiters and landers arrived.\\\\n\\\\n     mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past mars on july 14,\\\\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\\\\nsurface. transmitting to earth 22 close-up pictures of the\\\\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\\\\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\\\\nmariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\\\\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\\\\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\\\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\\\\n\\\\n     on may 30, 1971, the mariner 9 orbiter was launched on a\\\\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. the\\\\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\\\\nfind mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\\\\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. but after the\\\\nstorm cleared, mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\\\\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\\\\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\\\\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\\\\n\\\\n     in august and september 1975, the viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\\\\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\\\\nkennedy space center. the mission was designed to answer several\\\\nquestions about the red planet, including, is there life there?\\\\nnobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\\\\nhoped that the biology experiments on the viking landers would at\\\\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\\\\n\\\\n     viking lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\\\\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on july 20, 1976,\\\\nwhile the united states was celebrating its bicentennial. photos\\\\nsent back from the chryse planitia (\"plains of gold\") showed a\\\\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. panoramic images returned by the\\\\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\\\\nby rippled sand dunes. fine red dust from the martian soil gives\\\\nthe sky a salmon hue. when viking lander 2 touched down on utopia\\\\nplanitia on september 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\\\\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\\\\ndunes.\\\\n\\\\n     the results sent back by the laboratory on each viking\\\\nlander were inconclusive. small samples of the red martian soil\\\\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\\\\nbiological processes. while some of the test results seemed to\\\\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\\\\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\\\\\'s soil\\\\nchemistry. is there life on mars? no one knows for sure, but the\\\\nviking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\\\\nthere.\\\\n\\\\n     the viking landers became weather stations, recording wind\\\\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\\\\npressure. few weather changes were observed. the highest\\\\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees celsius (7\\\\ndegrees fahrenheit) at the viking lander 1 site in midsummer.\\\\n\\\\n     the lowest temperature, -120 degrees celsius (-184 degrees\\\\nfahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly viking lander 2\\\\nsite during winter. near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\\\\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\\\\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. viking\\\\nlander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\\\\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\\\\n\\\\n     the martian atmosphere, like that of venus, is primarily\\\\ncarbon dioxide. nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\\\\npercentages. martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\\\\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\\\\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\\\\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. local patches of early morning\\\\nfog can form in valleys.\\\\n\\\\n     there is evidence that in the past a denser martian\\\\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. physical\\\\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\\\\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\\\\n\\\\n     mars has two moons, phobos and deimos. they are small and\\\\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. it is\\\\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\\\\nclose to mars and were captured by its gravity.\\\\n\\\\n     the viking orbiters and landers exceeded by large margins\\\\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. the\\\\nfirst to fail was viking orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\\\\njuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\\\\nviking lander 2 operated until april 12, 1980, when it was shut\\\\ndown because of battery degeneration. viking orbiter 1 quit on\\\\naugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\\\\nused up. viking lander 1 ceased functioning on november 13, 1983.\\\\n\\\\n     despite the inconclusive results of the viking biology\\\\nexperiments, we know more about mars than any other planet except\\\\nearth. nasa\\\\\\'s mars observer spacecraft, to be launched in\\\\nseptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\\\\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nasteroids\\\\n\\\\n     the solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\\\\nobjects that are in orbit around the sun but are too small to be\\\\nconsidered full-fledged planets. these objects are known as\\\\nasteroids or minor planets. most, but not all, are found in a\\\\nband or belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter. some have\\\\norbits that cross earth\\\\\\'s path, and there is evidence that earth\\\\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. one of the least eroded,\\\\nbest preserved examples is the barringer meteor crater near\\\\nwinslow, arizona.\\\\n\\\\n     asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\\\\nsolar system. one theory suggests that they are the remains of a\\\\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. more\\\\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\\\\nplanet. in fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\\\\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\\\\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\\\\ndiameter of our moon. \\\\n\\\\n     thousands of asteroids have been identified from earth. it\\\\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\\\\nphotographed through earth-based telescopes.\\\\n\\\\n     much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\\\\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\\\\nearth. asteroids that are on a collision course with earth are\\\\ncalled meteoroids. when a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\\\\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\\\\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. if the\\\\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\\\\\'s left strikes\\\\nearth\\\\\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. one of the best places\\\\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of antarctica.\\\\n\\\\n     of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\\\\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\\\\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. stony\\\\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\\\\nlike terrestrial rocks.\\\\n\\\\n     since asteroids are material from the very early solar\\\\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\\\\nspacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\\\\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\\\\nseparated by very large distances.\\\\n\\\\n     current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\\\\nfor closer examination. the galileo orbiter, launched by nasa in\\\\noctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\\\\njupiter. the comet rendezvous/asteroid flyby (craf) and cassini\\\\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. scheduled for\\\\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the craf and cassini\\\\nmissions are a collaborative project of nasa, the european space\\\\nagency and the federal space agencies of germany and italy, as\\\\nwell as the united states air force and the department of energy.\\\\none day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\\\\nmaterials.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\njupiter\\\\n\\\\n     beyond mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\\\\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of jupiter, saturn,\\\\nuranus and neptune. in 1972, nasa dispatched the first of four\\\\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\\\\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. jupiter\\\\nwas the first port of call.\\\\n\\\\n     pioneer 10, which lifted off from kennedy space center in\\\\nmarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\\\\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. in\\\\ndecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of jupiter,\\\\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\\\\\'s\\\\nbanded cloud tops. pioneer 11 followed a year later. voyagers 1\\\\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\\\\nspectacular photographs of jupiter and its family of satellites\\\\nduring flybys in 1979.\\\\n\\\\n     these travelers found jupiter to be a whirling ball of\\\\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\\\\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. ammonia ice\\\\ncrystals form white jovian clouds. sulfur compounds (and perhaps\\\\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\\\\ncharacterize jupiter\\\\\\'s atmosphere.\\\\n\\\\n     it is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\\\\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\\\\nplanet\\\\\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\\\\nbelow. because of jupiter\\\\\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\\\\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\\\\n\\\\n     the great red spot has been observed for centuries through\\\\ntelescopes on earth. this hurricane-like storm in jupiter\\\\\\'s\\\\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. as a\\\\nhigh-pressure region, the great red spot spins in a direction\\\\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on jupiter; it is\\\\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\\\\nare sometimes consumed by it. the great red spot might be a\\\\nmillion years old.\\\\n\\\\n     our spacecraft detected lightning in jupiter\\\\\\'s upper\\\\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to earth\\\\\\'s\\\\nnorthern lights at the jovian polar regions. voyager 1 returned\\\\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling jupiter.\\\\n\\\\n     largest of the solar system\\\\\\'s planets, jupiter rotates at a\\\\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. the\\\\nmassive planet takes almost 12 earth years to complete a journey\\\\naround the sun. with 16 known moons, jupiter is something of a\\\\nminiature solar system.\\\\n\\\\n     a new mission to jupiter -- the galileo project -- is under\\\\nway. after a six- year cruise that takes the galileo orbiter once\\\\npast venus, twice past earth and the moon and once past two\\\\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\\\\njupiter\\\\\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to earth. the galileo\\\\norbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\\\\nto jupiter\\\\\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\\\\npioneers and two voyagers revealed.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\ngalilean satellites\\\\n\\\\n     in 1610, galileo galilei aimed his telescope at jupiter and\\\\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. for the first\\\\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. in honor of\\\\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\\\\ngalilean satellites or moons. but galileo might have happily\\\\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\\\\nreturned by the voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\\\\nplanet-sized satellites.\\\\n\\\\n     one of the most remarkable findings of the voyager mission\\\\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the galilean moon io.\\\\nvolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\\\\nother than earth. the voyager cameras identified at least nine\\\\nactive volcanoes on io, with plumes of ejected material extending\\\\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\\\\\'s surface.\\\\n\\\\n     io\\\\\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\\\\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\\\\nthe surface by volcanic activity. volcanic activity on this\\\\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\\\\ngravitational tug-of-war between io, jupiter and the other three\\\\ngalilean moons.\\\\n\\\\n     europa, approximately the same size as our moon, is the\\\\nbrightest galilean satellite. the moon\\\\\\'s surface displays a\\\\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\\\\nfractured. caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like io, europa\\\\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\\\\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. this ocean is covered\\\\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\\\\ncold of space. europa\\\\\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\\\\ncenter.\\\\n\\\\n     like europa, the other two galilean moons -- ganymede and\\\\ncallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. ganymede is the largest\\\\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets mercury\\\\nand pluto. the satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\\\\nice and the rest rock. ganymede\\\\\\'s surface has areas of different\\\\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\\\\nthe moon\\\\\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\\\\nsurface.\\\\n\\\\n     callisto, only slightly smaller than ganymede, has the\\\\nlowest density of any galilean satellite, suggesting that large\\\\namounts of water are part of its composition. callisto is the\\\\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\\\\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\\\\n\\\\n     detailed studies of all the galilean satellites will be\\\\nperformed by the galileo orbiter.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nsaturn\\\\n\\\\n     no planet in the solar system is adorned like saturn. its\\\\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. like jupiter, saturn is\\\\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. but in contrast to the vivid colors\\\\nand wild turbulence found in jovian clouds, saturn\\\\\\'s atmosphere\\\\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\\\\nby high-altitude haze. given saturn\\\\\\'s somewhat placid-looking\\\\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\\\\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\\\\nmiles) per hour.\\\\n\\\\n     three american spacecraft have visited saturn. pioneer 11\\\\nsped by the planet and its moon titan in september 1979,\\\\nreturning the first close-up images. voyager 1 followed in\\\\nnovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\\\\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of saturn\\\\\\'s ring\\\\nsystem and moons. voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\\\\naugust 1981.\\\\n\\\\n     the rings are composed of countless low-density particles\\\\norbiting individually around saturn\\\\\\'s equator at progressive\\\\ndistances from the cloud tops. analysis of spacecraft radio waves\\\\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\\\\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. the rings are\\\\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\\\\n\\\\n     the rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\\\\nventured too close to saturn. the unlucky object would have been\\\\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\\\\ninterior. or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\\\\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of saturn\\\\\\'s gravity. a\\\\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\\\\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\\\\n\\\\n     unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\\\\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\\\\nthe gravitational pull of saturn and its satellites. these\\\\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\\\\nthat make up the major rings.\\\\n\\\\n     radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an am\\\\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the voyager\\\\nspacecraft. these emissions are typical of lightning but are\\\\nbelieved to be coming from saturn\\\\\\'s ring system rather than its\\\\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. as they had at\\\\njupiter, the voyagers saw a version of earth\\\\\\'s auroras near\\\\nsaturn\\\\\\'s poles.\\\\n\\\\n     the voyagers discovered new moons and found several\\\\nsatellites that share the same orbit. we learned that some moons\\\\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining saturn\\\\\\'s rings and the gaps\\\\nin the rings. saturn\\\\\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\\\\nimages taken by voyager 2 in 1981. \\\\n\\\\n     voyager 1 determined that titan has a nitrogen-based\\\\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like earth\\\\\\'s in\\\\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of mars and\\\\nvenus. titan\\\\\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees celsius (-290\\\\ndegrees fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\\\\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\\\\nunfortunately, voyager\\\\\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\\\\\'s\\\\ndense clouds.\\\\n\\\\n     continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\\\\nconverting titan\\\\\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\\\\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. the latter\\\\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. these conditions may\\\\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval earth\\\\nbetween three and four billion years ago. however, titan\\\\\\'s\\\\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\\\\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\\\\n\\\\n     the exploration of saturn will continue with the cassini\\\\nmission. the cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\\\\nalso deploy a probe called huygens, which will be dropped into\\\\ntitan\\\\\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. cassini will use the\\\\nprobe as well as radar to peer through titan\\\\\\'s clouds and will\\\\nspend years examining the saturnian system.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nuranus\\\\n\\\\n     in january 1986, four and a half years after visiting\\\\nsaturn, voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\\\\nuranian system. the brief flyby revealed more information about\\\\nuranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\\\\nground observations since the planet\\\\\\'s discovery over two\\\\ncenturies ago by the english astronomer william herschel.\\\\n\\\\n     uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\\\\nsolar system. unlike the other planets (with the exception of\\\\npluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\\\\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\\\\naround the solar system. during voyager 2\\\\\\'s flyby, the south pole\\\\nfaced the sun. uranus might have been knocked over when an\\\\nearth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\\\\nsolar system.\\\\n\\\\n     voyager 2 found that uranus\\\\\\' magnetic field does not follow\\\\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. instead,\\\\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\\\\\'s\\\\ncenter, a phenomenon that on earth would be like having one\\\\nmagnetic pole in new york city and the other in the city of\\\\ndjakarta, on the island of java in indonesia.\\\\n\\\\n     uranus\\\\\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\\\\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\\\\nvapor. the planet\\\\\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\\\\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. wind speeds range up to 580\\\\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\\\\ntops average -221 degrees celsius (-366 degrees fahrenheit).\\\\n\\\\n     uranus\\\\\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\\\\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\\\\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. surrounding the\\\\nplanet\\\\\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\\\\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\\\\n\\\\n     approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below uranus\\\\\\'\\\\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\\\\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\\\\nbeneath this ocean is an earth-sized core of heavier materials.\\\\n\\\\n     voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\\\\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting uranus. the five previously known --\\\\nmiranda, ariel, umbriel, titania and oberon -- range in size from\\\\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. representing\\\\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\\\\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\\\\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\\\\n\\\\n     the most remarkable of uranus\\\\\\' moons is miranda. its surface\\\\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\\\\nwinding valleys. the sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\\\\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\\\\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\\\\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\\\\nfrom large impacts. what is extraordinary is that miranda\\\\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\\\\nits interior exposed on its surface.\\\\n\\\\n     uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; voyager 2 imaged\\\\n11. in contrast to saturn\\\\\\'s rings, which are composed of bright\\\\nparticles, uranus\\\\\\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\\\\nboulder-sized chunks.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nneptune\\\\n\\\\n     voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\\\\nwith an investigation of neptune and the planet\\\\\\'s moons. on\\\\naugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\\\\n(3,010 miles) of neptune and then flew on to the moon triton.\\\\nduring the neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\\\\\'s\\\\natmosphere was more active than uranus\\\\\\'. \\\\n\\\\n     voyager 2 observed the great dark spot, a circular storm the\\\\nsize of earth, in neptune\\\\\\'s atmosphere. resembling jupiter\\\\\\'s\\\\ngreat red spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\\\\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. voyager\\\\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\\\\nthe \"scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\\\\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. the highest wind speeds of any\\\\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\\\\nhour.\\\\n\\\\n     like the other giant planets, neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\\\\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. the planet\\\\\\'s core\\\\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\\\\nother gas giants. neptune\\\\\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\\\\nuranus\\\\\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\\\\n\\\\n     neptune\\\\\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\\\\\'s\\\\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. this phenomenon is\\\\nsimilar to uranus\\\\\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\\\\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\\\\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\\\\nelectrical properties of a metal. earth\\\\\\'s magnetic field, on the\\\\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\\\\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\\\\n\\\\n     voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of neptune\\\\\\'s rings.\\\\nobservations from earth indicated that there were arcs of\\\\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. it was not clear how\\\\nneptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\\\\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. voyager 2 detected\\\\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\\\\na number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\\\\nwere not spotted.\\\\n\\\\n     astronomers had identified the neptunian moons triton in\\\\n1846 and nereid in 1949. voyager 2 found six more. one of the new\\\\nmoons -- proteus -- is actually larger than nereid, but since\\\\nproteus orbits close to neptune, it was lost in the planet\\\\\\'s\\\\nglare for observers on earth.\\\\n\\\\n      triton circles neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\\\\ndays. tidal forces on triton are causing it to spiral slowly\\\\ntowards the planet. in 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\\\\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that neptunian\\\\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\\\\naccompany the planet\\\\\\'s modest current rings.\\\\n\\\\n     triton\\\\\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\\\\nio and miranda. the moon has more rock than its counterparts at\\\\nsaturn and uranus. triton\\\\\\'s mantle is probably composed of\\\\nwater-ice, but the moon\\\\\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\\\\nmethane. the moon shows two dramatically different types of\\\\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\\\\ncap. \\\\n\\\\n     dark streaks appear on the ice cap. these streaks are the\\\\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\\\\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\\\\n(1 to 5 miles). triton\\\\\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\\\\nthick as earth\\\\\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\\\\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\\\\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees celsius, -391 degrees\\\\nfahrenheit). triton might be more like pluto than any other\\\\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\npluto\\\\n\\\\n     pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\\\\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\\\\nneptune\\\\\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\\\\nremain until march 1999. pluto\\\\\\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\\\\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\\\\n\\\\n     discovered in 1930, pluto appears to be little more than a\\\\ncelestial snowball. the planet\\\\\\'s diameter is calculated to be\\\\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\\\\nsize of our moon. ground-based observations indicate that pluto\\\\\\'s\\\\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\\\\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\\\\nmoves away from the sun. observations also show that pluto\\\\\\'s spin\\\\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \\\\n\\\\n     the planet has one known satellite, charon, discovered in\\\\n1978. charon\\\\\\'s surface composition is different from pluto\\\\\\'s: the\\\\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\\\\nice. its orbit is gravitationally locked with pluto, so both\\\\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. pluto\\\\\\'s\\\\nand charon\\\\\\'s rotational period and charon\\\\\\'s period of revolution\\\\nare all 6.4 earth days. \\\\n\\\\n     although no spacecraft have ever visited pluto, nasa is\\\\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\ncomets\\\\n\\\\n     the outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\\\\nvisit to the inner planets. as asteroids are the rocky and\\\\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\\\\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\\\\nfar from the sun. most comet nuclei reside in the oort cloud, a\\\\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\\\\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\\\\n\\\\n     comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\\\\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\\\\nto the sun. as a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\\\\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\\\\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\\\\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. the nucleus itself\\\\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\\\\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\\\\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\\\\n\\\\n     as these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\\\\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\\\\nkilometers across. the coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\\\\nsun. the stream of charged particles coming from the sun pushes\\\\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\\\\nrise to the comet\\\\\\'s \"tails.\" gases and ions are blown directly\\\\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\\\\nas the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\\\\nleft behind in a curved arc.\\\\n\\\\n     both the gas and dust tails point away from the sun; in\\\\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the sun.\\\\nthe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\\\\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\\\\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. comets --\\\\nfrom the latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\\\\ndramatic light shows.\\\\n\\\\n     some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\\\\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\\\\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. these latter\\\\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\\\\nto the inner solar system.\\\\n\\\\n     halley\\\\\\'s comet is the most famous example of a relatively\\\\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\\\\nyears and orbiting from beyond neptune to within venus\\\\\\' orbit.\\\\nconfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 b.c. this regular\\\\nvisitor to our solar system is named for sir edmond halley,\\\\nbecause he plotted the comet\\\\\\'s orbit and predicted its return,\\\\nbased on earlier sightings and newtonian laws of motion. his name\\\\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\\\\nreturned on schedule. unfortunately, sir edmond did not live to\\\\nsee it.\\\\n\\\\n     a comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\\\\ncomparatively close to earth. unfortunately, on its most recent\\\\nappearance, halley\\\\\\'s comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\\\\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. the comet was\\\\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\\\\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. comets have been so\\\\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\\\\nhistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\\\\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\\\\n\\\\n     the comet rendezvous/asteroid flyby (craf) spacecraft will\\\\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\\\\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the sun. craf\\\\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\\\\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\\\\nform a coma and tails. several spacecraft have flown by comets at\\\\nhigh speed; the first was nasa\\\\\\'s international cometary explorer\\\\nin 1985. an armada of five spacecraft (two japanese, two soviet\\\\nand the giotto spacecraft from the european space agency) flew by\\\\nhalley\\\\\\'s comet in 1986.\\\\n     \\\\n\\\\nconclusion\\\\n\\\\n     despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\\\\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\\\\nonly one body they could study closely -- earth. but since 1959,\\\\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\\\\nneighbors in space. \\\\n\\\\n     we have learned more about our solar system and its members\\\\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. our automated\\\\nspacecraft have traveled to the moon and to all the planets\\\\nbeyond our world except pluto; they have observed moons as large\\\\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\\\\nenvironment. astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\\\\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\\\\ngenerations. we are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\\\\nand beautiful places and objects.\\\\n\\\\n     the knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\\\\nsystem has redefined traditional earth sciences like geology and\\\\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\\\\ncomparative planetology. by studying the geology of planets,\\\\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\\\\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\\\\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\\\\n\\\\n     we are also gaining insight into earth\\\\\\'s complex weather\\\\nsystems. by seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\\\\ninvestigating the sun\\\\\\'s activity and its influence throughout the\\\\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\\\\nprocesses on earth.\\\\n\\\\n     we will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\\\\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. one current mission\\\\nis mapping venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\\\\nthe sun and jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. future\\\\nmissions are planned for mars, saturn, a comet and the asteroid\\\\nbelt.\\\\n\\\\n     we can also look forward to the time when humans will once\\\\nagain set foot on an alien world. although astronauts have not\\\\nbeen back to the moon since december 1972, plans are being\\\\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\\\\nhuman exploration of mars and even the establishment of martian\\\\noutposts. one day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\\\\nlunar base or a martian colony!\\\\n\\\\n- end -\\\\n     \\\\n\\', \\'from: drchambe@tekig5.pen.tek.com (dennis chamberlin)\\\\nsubject: re: planets still: images orbit

not apply to you. in\\\\n    general, however, systems connected to \\\\\\'the net\\\\\\' fall in one of three\\\\n    categories: internet, usenet, or bitnet. electronic mail may be sent\\\\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\\\\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\\\\n    special \\\\\\'servers\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\n    the space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\\\\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\\\\n\\\\n    one mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\\\\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. in\\\\n    addition to the general lists for space (called space digest for\\\\n    internet users, and space on bitnet), there are a number of more\\\\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\\\\n\\\\n    a second mechanism is usenet \\\\\\'netnews\\\\\\'. this is somewhat like a bulletin\\\\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. netnews\\\\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\\\\n    \\\\\\'group name\\\\\\'. the groups dealing most closely with space topics are\\\\n    called \\\\\\'sci.space.news\\\\\\', \\\\\\'sci.space\\\\\\', \\\\\\'sci.space.shuttle\\\\\\', \\\\\\'sci.astro\\\\\\',\\\\n    and \\\\\\'talk.politics.space\\\\\\'. contributors \\\\\\'post\\\\\\' submissions (called\\\\n    \\\\\\'articles\\\\\\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\\\\n    it to other nearby machines. similarly, articles sent from nearby\\\\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\\\\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the usenet\\\\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\\\\n    posted.\\\\n\\\\n    gateway machines redirect the usenet sci.space group into internet and\\\\n    bitnet mailing lists and vice versa; the other usenet groups are not\\\\n    accessible as mailing lists. if you can receive netnews, its more\\\\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\\\\n    it the preferred option.\\\\n\\\\nmailing lists\\\\n\\\\n    space digest is the main internet list, and is now being run by the\\\\n    international space university

under the pretense that it\\\\\\'s good for pan-european\\\\ncooperation.\\\\n\\\\nnow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\\\\nmoney (in fact, i\\\\\\'m pretty sure you do), but it does count as\\\\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\\\\nthe size of that multiplier :->).\\\\n\\\\nnick haines nickh@cmu.edu\\\\n\\', \\'from:

into\\\\nthe support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  there\\\\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\\\\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before wwii.\\\\nthe us research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\\\\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  there were not that\\\\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\\\\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\\\\ntravel to scientific meetings.  not that much, but it was provided, and a\\\\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\\\\nas salary.\\\\n\\\\nduring wwii, the military and the defense departments found that pure\\\\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \\\\nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\\\\\' expertise.  this is\\\\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\\\\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\\\\nemerges.  this works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\\\\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\\\\n\\\\nthe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\\\\nfuture, and started funding pure research after wwii.  but congress was\\\\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\\\\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \\\\nnsf, to do the job.  it also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\\\\nkeep politics out.  also, the government did a job on private foundations,\\\\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\\\\n\\\\nthe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\\\\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\\\\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  suppose,\\\\nas has been the case, i have a project which could use the assistance of\\\\na graduate student for a few months.  what do you think happens if i ask\\\\nfor one?  the answer i will get is, \"get the money from nsf.\"  now the\\\\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the nsf level it\\\\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\\\\ngetting supported.  so the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\\\\nget supported, and how much.  \\\\n\\\\nalso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  so instead\\\\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\\\\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\\\\nbeing.  and instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\\\\nreseach proposals.  as a researcher, i can tell you that any research proposal\\\\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\\\\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  what i am\\\\nproposing today i may solve before the funding is granted, i may find \\\\nimpossible, or i may find that it is too difficult.  in addition, tomorrow\\\\ni may get unexpected research results.  possibly i may bet a bright idea\\\\nwhich solves yesterday\\\\\\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to\\\\nsomething i had not considered can develop.  this is the nature of the beast, \\\\nand except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it\\\\nis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring \\\\nmore than minimal attention of a good researcher.  \\\\n\\\\ni believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would\\\\nhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government\\\\nis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.\\\\n-- \\\\nherman rubin, dept. of statistics,

sacred - \\\\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  the space between the stars \\\\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  with full horizons and \\\\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\\\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\\\nany lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\\\nwhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\\\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\\\nin an afterlife.  \\\\n\\\\nthe space age changed all that.  the effect of the first sputniks \\\\nand echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  to see a light \\\\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\\\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\\\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\\\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\\\nbut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\\\n\\\\nyes, i know aircraft are almost always in sight.  i have to live \\\\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\\\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  the \\\\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\\\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\\\ninto shape by the hands of man.  in some places the only life \\\\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\\\n(or rats).  i visited some friends up in the appalacian mountains \\\\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\\\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then i quickly noticed \\\\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into dulles - 60-80 \\\\nmiles to the east.  (their \\\\\\'security light\\\\\\' didn\\\\\\'t help matters \\\\nmuch either.)  but i\\\\\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\\\nhigh air traffic.  so i know the skies are rarely perfect. \\\\n\\\\nbut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\\\\\'t \\\\nfouled in some way.  (i mean they\\\\\\'ve been trying this forever - \\\\nlike, concerning tesla\\\\\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  i don\\\\\\'t watch \\\\ncommercial television, but i can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\\\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\\\nif ya\\\\\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\\\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\\\n\\\\nto be open about this though, i have here my listing of the passage \\\\nof hst in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight friday at \\\\n8:25 p.m. edt it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\\\nlocal meridian from baltimore vicinity.  i\\\\\\'ll be trying to see it \\\\nif i can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  so i suppose i could \\\\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\\\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  be that \\\\nas it may, i think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\\\neven if it can\\\\\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \\\\n\\\\nregards, \\\\nwm. hathaway \\\\nbaltimore md \\\\n\\', \\'from: dietz@cs.rochester.edu (paul dietz)\\\\nsubject: re: nuclear waste\\\\norganization: university of rochester\\\\n\\\\nin article <844@rins.ryukoku.ac.jp> will@rins.ryukoku.ac.jp (william reiken) writes:\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\tok, so how about the creation of oil producing bacteria?  i figure\\\\n> that if you can make them to eat it up then you can make them to shit it.\\\\n> any comments?\\\\n\\\\nthey exist.  even photosynthetic varieties.  not economical at this\\\\ntime, though.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tpaul f. dietz\\\\n\\\\tdietz@cs.rochester.edu\\\\n\\', \\'from: thomsonal@cpva.saic.com\\\\nsubject: cosmos 2238: an eorsat\\\\narticle-i.d.: cpva.15337.2bc16ada\\\\norganization: science applications int\\\\\\'l corp./san diego\\\\nlines: 48\\\\n\\\\n>date: tue, 6 apr 1993 15:40:47 gmt\\\\n\\\\n>i need as much information about cosmos 2238 and its rocket fragment (1993-\\\\n>018b) as possible. both its purpose, launch date, location, in short,\\\\n>everything! can you help?\\\\n\\\\n>-tony ryan, \"astronomy & space\", new international magazine, available from:\\\\n\\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nocean reconnaissance launch surprises west\\\\nspace news, april 5-11, 1993, p.2\\\\n[excerpts]\\\\n     russia launched its first ocean reconnaissance satellite in 26 months \\\\nmarch 30, confounding western analysts who had proclaimed the program dead. \\\\n     the itar-tass news agency announced the launch of cosmos 2238 from \\\\nplesetsk cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload\\\\\\'s mission. \\\\n     however, based on the satellite\\\\\\'s trajectory, western observers \\\\nidentified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic \\\\nemissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement. \\\\n     geoff perry of the kettering group in england...

      here\\\\\\'s how i understand it. remember from stellar evolution that \\\\nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\\\\nm(star)=1.4m(sun).  high mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\\\\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  in this time,\\\\nthey don\\\\\\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\\\\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of grb\\\\\\'s) will be in the plane of the\\\\ngalaxy.  \\\\n        then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\\\\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (pioneer venus has one, either\\\\npion. 10 or 11, ginga, and of course batse) and we do distribution tests on our\\\\ncatalog.  these tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\\\\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\\\\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  so, unless we are\\\\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the universe.\\\\nnot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  now, i\\\\nsuppose you are saying, \"well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\\\\ndisk.\"  well, not necessarily.  remember, we have what is more or less an\\\\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\\\\nto beyond pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\\\\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  here\\\\\\'s an \\\\nanalogy:  you see a plane overhead.  you measure the angle of the plane from\\\\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  one of your friends a mile\\\\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\\\\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  the two angles are different,\\\\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\\\\nfind a source.  to my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \\\\n        i should throw in why halo, and corona models don\\\\\\'t work, also.  as i\\\\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\\\\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\\\\nbehavior.  if this is the case, as i said before, these stars seem to be bound\\\\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\\\\nwhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\\\\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\\\\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \\\\nin the direction of the  galactic center.  as i said before, there is none of\\\\nthese characteristics.  \\\\n        \\\\n        i think that\\\\\\'s all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knows\\\\nsomething that i don\\\\\\'t know, by all means correct me.  i had the honor of\\\\ntaking the bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these\\\\ndifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible\\\\ndistribution there was, and some very outrageous sources. colliding pulsars,\\\\nblack holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   it\\\\\\'s a fun\\\\nfield. \\\\n        complaints and corrections to:

the\\\\nmarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.\\\\nthis prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.\\\\n\\\\non the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \"high-ti\" basalts (apollo 11\\\\nand 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  this is nice, but...\\\\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\\\\ntitanium.  they very often have 3% tio2, frequently have 4%, and\\\\nsometimes even 5% tio2 (again, by weight).  these flood basalts are\\\\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\\\\nworld (siberia, brazil, the nw united states, ethiopia, etc.).  if\\\\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% tio2, this is trillions of tons of tio2\\\\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-ti\\\\nbasalts.  it is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon\\\\ncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the\\\\nore (never mind the richer, but

universe of motion\" contains final solutions to \\\\n          most all astrophysical mysteries. \\\\n          \\\\n               this book is volume iii of a revised and enlarged \\\\n          edition of \"the structure of the physical universe\", 1959.  \\\\n          volume i is \"nothing but motion\" (1979), and volume ii is \\\\n          \"the basic properties of matter\" (1988). \\\\n          \\\\n               most books and journal articles on the subject of \\\\n          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial \\\\n          differentials, and other fancy mathematics.  in this book, by \\\\n          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except \\\\n          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  \\\\n          larson emphasizes concepts and declares that mathematical \\\\n          agreement with a theory does not guarantee its conceptual \\\\n          validity. \\\\n          \\\\n               dewey b. larson was a retired engineer with a bachelor \\\\n          of science degree in engineering science from oregon state \\\\n          university.  he developed the theory described in his books \\\\n          while trying to find a way to mathematically calculate the \\\\n          properties of chemical compounds based only on the elements \\\\n          they contain. \\\\n          \\\\n               \"the universe of motion\" describes the astrophysical \\\\n          portions of larson\\\\\\'s consistent, integrated, comprehensive, \\\\n          general unified theory of the physical universe, a kind of \\\\n          \"grand unified field theory\" that orthodox physicists and \\\\n          astro-physicists claim to be looking for.  it is built on two \\\\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of \\\\n          space and time: \\\\n          \\\\n               (1) the physical universe is composed entirely of one \\\\n          component, motion, existing in three dimensions, in discrete \\\\n          units, and with two reciprocal aspects, space and time. \\\\n          \\\\n               (2) the physical universe conforms to the relations of \\\\n          ordinary commutative mathematics, its primary magnitudes are \\\\n          absolute, and its geometry is euclidean. \\\\n          \\\\n               from these two postulates, larson was able to build a \\\\n          complete theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic \\\\n          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the \\\\n          concept of inward and outward scalar motions with \\\\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-\\\\n          vibrational motions.  at each step in the development, he was \\\\n          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with \\\\n          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including \\\\n          even things not yet discovered.  for example, in his 1959 \\\\n          book, he first predicted the existence of exploding galaxies, \\\\n          several years before astronomers started finding them.  they \\\\n          are a necessary consequence of his comprehensive theory.  and \\\\n          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation \\\\n          ready for those also. \\\\n          \\\\n               as a result of his theory, which he called \"the \\\\n          reciprocal system\", larson totally rejected many of the \\\\n          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, \\\\n          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, \\\\n          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), \\\\n          \"nuclear\" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass \\\\n          increases, relativistic doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in \\\\n          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be \\\\n          nothing more than mathematical fantasies.  he was very \\\\n          critical of the ad hoc assumptions, uncertainty principles, \\\\n          solutions in principle, \"no other way\" declarations, etc., \\\\n          used to maintain them. \\\\n          \\\\n               \"the universe of motion\" is divided into 31 chapters.  \\\\n          it begins with a description of how galaxies are built from \\\\n          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, \\\\n          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that \\\\n          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in \\\\n          from the anti-matter half of the physical universe.  (galaxy \\\\n          formation from the mythical \"big bang\" is a big mystery to \\\\n          orthodox astronomers.)  he then goes on to describe life \\\\n          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and \\\\n          solar systems result from type i supernova explosions of \\\\n          single stars. \\\\n          \\\\n               several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according \\\\n          to larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have \\\\n          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies \\\\n          and are actually traveling faster than the speed of light \\\\n          (although most of that speed is away from us in time). \\\\n          \\\\n               astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against \\\\n          observations that contradict their theories would find \\\\n          larson\\\\\\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an \\\\n          open mind.  for example, they used to believe that gamma ray \\\\n          bursts originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the \\\\n          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  but the new gamma ray \\\\n          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from \\\\n          all directions uniformly and do not correspond with any \\\\n          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional \\\\n          coincidence).  larson\\\\\\'s explanation is that the gamma ray \\\\n          bursts originate from supernova explosions in the anti-matter \\\\n          half of the physical universe, which larson calls the \"cosmic \\\\n          sector\".  because the anti-matter universe exists in a \\\\n          reciprocal relation to our material universe, with the speed \\\\n          of light as the boundary between them, and has three \\\\n          dimensions of time and only one dimension of space, the \\\\n          bursts can pop into our material universe anywhere seemingly \\\\n          at random. \\\\n          \\\\n               larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from \\\\n          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and \\\\n          astronomers.  in this book, 351 of them are superscripted \\\\n          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the \\\\n          end of the book.  for example, a quote from the book \\\\n          \"astronomy: the cosmic journey\", by william k. hartmann, \\\\n          says, \"our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if \\\\n          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars \\\\n          form.... unfortunately we cannot.\"  larson\\\\\\'s book contains \\\\n          logical consistent explanations of such mysteries that are \\\\n          worthy of serious consideration by all physicists, \\\\n          astronomers, and astrophysicists. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n               for more information, answers to

0-89464-039-9\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nthis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\\\\ntechnological phenomenon.  the idea of a vehicle for traversing the\\\\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\\\\ntlatter half of theis century.  the need preceded the ability ot make\\\\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  as soon as it was realized\\\\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\\\\nreach them.   \\\\n\\\\ntracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\\\\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\\\\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  once space travel\\\\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\\\\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\\\\nmatter.  these also are described in theis book, for the same reason\\\\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\\\\nreflections of their particular era\\'s dreams, abilities, and\\\\nknowledge.  virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\\\\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\\\\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  the chronological\\\\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\\\\nspeculative ventures.  they also allow comparisons between\\\\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  they reveal\\\\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  every\\\\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  nearly every\\\\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  this\\\\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\\\\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\\\\n\\\\nthis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\\\\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\\\\ndiagrams.   science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\\\\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  the\\\\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\\\\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\\\\n\\\\nspecial features\\\\n\\\\nincludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\\\\nfictional\\\\n\\\\ncontains

this\\\\ntime!  let\\'s step back and consider the functionality we want:\\\\n\\\\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\\\\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\\\\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \\\\n\\\\nthe old nasa approach, explified by shuttle and ssf so far, was to\\\\ncentralize functionality.  these projects failed to meet\\\\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \\\\ntook most of their payloads off shuttle after wasting much effort to \\\\ntie their payloads to it, and ssf has crumbled into disorganization\\\\nand miscommunication.  over $50 billion has been spent on these\\\\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\\\\nin commercial space industrialization.  meanwhile, military and commercial \\\\nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \\\\nconstellation.  \\\\n\\\\nfirstly, different functions are broken down into different \\\\nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\\\\nthus we have the gps/navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\\\\ncomsats in clarke and molniya orbits, etc.  secondly, the task\\\\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\\\\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\\\\n\\\\nssf\\'s 3 main functions require quite different environments\\\\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\\\\n\\\\n[1] we have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\\\\ncomet and mir for long-duration flights, shuttle/spacelab for\\\\nshort-duration flights.  the best strategy for this area is\\\\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of u.s. facilities \\\\non mir, shuttle/mir linkup, and transition from shuttle/spacelab\\\\nto a much less expensive ssto/spacehab/comet or ssto/sif/comet.\\\\nwe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \\\\ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation van allen belt \\\\nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  the comet system can\\\\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \\\\nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond leo.\\\\n\\\\n[2] we need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\\\\nbut also in lunar and martian gravities, and in the radiation\\\\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\\\\nof leo.  this is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\\\\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\\\\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  furthermore, using\\\\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\\\\nand the sample size.  so i propose labratsat, a constellation\\\\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\\\\nin super-van-allen-belt orbits that are representative of the\\\\nradiation environment encountered on earth-moon, earth-mars,\\\\nearth-asteroid, etc. trips.  the miniaturized life support\\\\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a vr\\\\ninterface.  after several orbital missions have been flown,\\\\nfollow-ons can act as ldefs on the lunar and martian surface,\\\\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\\\\nare spent on astronauts.\\\\n\\\\n[3] by far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \\\\nclarke orbit.  i propose a fleet of small teleoperated\\\\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\\\\npractice their skills.  once in place, robots can pry stuck\\\\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\\\\ninject fuel, etc.  once the fleet is working, it can be\\\\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\\\\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\\\\n\\\\nby applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\\\\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of sts and old ssf, we\\\\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\\\\ngreatly cutting its cost.  for a fraction of ssf\\'s pricetag,\\\\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\\\\nlife\\'s adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \\\\nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\\\\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\\\\norbits.\\\\n\\\\nn.b., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\\\\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \\\\nmars network and artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \\\\nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on mars that can be used\\\\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\\\\nsample return.  the descendants of labratsat\\'s technology can\\\\nbe used as a mars surface ldef and to test out closed-ecology\\\\ngreenhouses on mars at low cost.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n-- \\\\nnick szabo\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t

illinois at urbana\\\\nlines: 91\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ni\\\\\\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. i\\\\\\'ve \\\\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  since my note taking ability is by no means\\\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  permission is \\\\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\\\n\\\\nnote for newbies:  the delta clipper project is geared towards producing a\\\\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  the dc-x vehicle is a 1/3\\\\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in ssto.  it is \\\\ncurrently undergoing tests.  the dc-y vehicle would be a full scale \\\\nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  it has not yet been funded.\\\\n\\\\non april 6th, rocky nelson of macdonnell douglas gave a talk entitled \\\\n\"optimizing techniques for advanced space missions\" here at the university of\\\\nillinois. mr nelson\\\\\\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\\\\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  although he is\\\\nnot directly involved with the delta clipper project, he has spent time with \\\\nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  he thus used \\\\nthe dc-y project for most of his examples.  while i don\\\\\\'t think the details\\\\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (i hope\\\\nthey aren\\\\\\'t - i fell asleep during that part), i think that many of you will\\\\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\\\\n\\\\nthe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  the\\\\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 gs.  i assume that\\\\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but i\\\\ndid not verify that.  the delta clipper y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\\\\nand 4 sustainers.  the boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \\\\nmid-flight.  thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  mr nelson\\\\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\\\\n                  ______\\\\n3 g         /|   /      |\\\\n           / |  /       |          as ascii graphs go, this is actually fairly \\\\n          /  | /        |\\\\t   good.  the big difference is that the lines\\\\n2 g      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\\\\n        /               |          concave up.  the data is only approximate, as\\\\n       /                |          the graph wasn\\\\\\'t up for very long.\\\\n1 g   /                 |\\\\n                        |\\\\n                        |\\\\n0 g                     |\\\\n\\\\n             ^          ^\\\\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nas mentioned before, a critical constraint is that g levels must be kept below\\\\n3.  initially, all eight engines are started.  as the vehicle  burns fuel the\\\\naccelleration increases.  as it gets close to 3g, the booster engines are \\\\nthrotled back.  however, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\\\\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  this causes the dip in \\\\naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  eventually the remaining sustainer engines\\\\nbring the g level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\\\\nout entirely.\\\\n\\\\nthe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  the trajectory is aimed\\\\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\\\\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \\\\nthat desired.\\\\n\\\\nquestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\\\\n\\\\nq:  would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\\\\n    all at once?\\\\n\\\\na:  very perceptive.  worth considering.  they have not yet done the simulation.    shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\\\\n\\\\nq:  so what was the final payload for this trajectory?\\\\n\\\\na:  can\\\\\\'t tell us.  \"read aviation leak.\"  he also apparently had a good \\\\n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \\\\n\\\\nmy question:  does anyone know if this security is due to sdio protecting\\\\nnational security or md protecting their own interests?\\\\n\\\\nthe second example was

[however, putting\\\\na 10\\\\\\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\\\\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\\\\nopinion.]  [and by the way, i note that the dc-x test vehicle has\\\\nrather prominent mcdonnell-douglas and sdio logos on the side...]\\\\n   there have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\\\\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\\\\nadvertising signs in orbit.  on the shuttle, for example, i know of\\\\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\\\\\\'s which looked at\\\\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\\\\nbay.  these ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\\\\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\\\\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\\\\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (for\\\\nexample, painting the et to look like a pepsi can, or putting a\\\\ndisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\\\\nwould scan past it.)\\\\n  \\\\nadverts on launch vehicles\\\\n   the first paid advertising was done on a soviet launcher in about\\\\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\\\\nto pay to put their logos on a proton launch.  (an italian shoe\\\\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, i remember.)  similarly,\\\\nsoviet cosmonauts on mir made a paid advertisement for the last\\\\nolympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\\\\nparticipating firms and organizations.  mars candy bars, for\\\\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\\\\nbritish visiting cosmonaut to mir.\\\\n   now us firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\\\\nvehicles.  the upcoming conestoga launch (in june) putting the comet\\\\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\\\\non the side, for arnold schwarzenegger\\\\\\'s upcoming movie \"the last\\\\naction hero\".  besides the usual logos of the participating\\\\norganizations, columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\\\\nmain fuselage of the mission\\\\\\'s conestoga rocket, its booster\\\\nrockets, and on the comet payload, which will orbit the earth for\\\\none month.  a concept for this advertising display was published in\\\\nspace news magazine a couple of months ago.\\\\n   (as a side note: robert lorsch, an advertising executive, is\\\\ntalking about suing nasa.  he charges nasa with appropriating an idea he\\\\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\\\\nsponsorships on nasa spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\\\\nspace program.  lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\\\\nthe upcoming comet, nasa violated an agreement that it \"would not use\\\\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for nasa and\\\\nreceiving compensation.\"   this is being disputed, since the launch\\\\nis a \"commercial launch\" and nasa is receiving none of the\\\\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the comet program is\\\\ncoming from nasa.)\\\\n  \\\\norbital \"billboards\"\\\\n   orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\\\\nsome time.  arthur c. clarke wrote about one

51\\\\n\\\\nwhy do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  for\\\\nexample, why couldn\\\\\\'t magellan just be told to go into a \"safe\"\\\\nmode and stay bobbing about venus in a low-power-use mode and if\\\\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\\\\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \\\\n\\\\nfor that matter, why exactly were the apollo lunar experiments\\\\n\"turned off\" rather than just \"safed\".  was it political (i.e.\\\\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\\\\ncongress for funds)?  turning them off keeps them pesky\\\\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\\\\\\'s hair....  \\\\n\\\\ni\\\\\\'ve heard the argument that an active but \"uncontrolled\"\\\\nspacecraft causes \"radio noise.\"  i find that hard to believe\\\\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed \"safe\" mode.\\\\nthis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\\\\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\\\\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on earth.\\\\nat that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\\\\ncontinue.  if no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\\\\nthe safe mode for another time period. as we would know when the\\\\nspacecraft is going to try to contact earth, we could be\\\\nprepared if necessary.  \\\\n\\\\nas another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\\\\nbeam stored data towards earth.  if someone can receive it,\\\\ngreat, if not, so it\\\\\\'s lost and no big deal.\\\\nby making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\\\\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\\\\ndata even if they\\\\\\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\\\\n\\\\ni see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\\\\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\\\\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (jupiter/saturn orbit,\\\\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \\\\n\\\\nperhaps those designing future spacecraft (cassini, pluto flyby,\\\\netc) should consider designing in a \"pause\" mode in case their\\\\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\\\\nthe primary mission. perhaps mars observer and galilleo could\\\\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\\\\n\"drift\"

april 22 and 23, delta differenced one-way range (dor) passes were\\\\nperformed over dss-14/63 (goldstone/madrid 70 meter antennas) and dss-14/43\\\\n(goldstone/canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  initial results \\\\nindicate the delta dor pass on april 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\\\\nstation hardware problems but the one on april 23 was successfully performed.\\\\n\\\\n2.  on april 23, a cruise science memory readout (mro) was performed for the\\\\nmagnetometer (mag) instrument.  analysis indicates the data was received\\\\nproperly.\\\\n\\\\n3.  on april 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\\\\nspacecraft stored sequence.  these relays were commanded closed by the cds\\\\n(command data subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\\\\npreclude the possibility at jupiter of the pps relays/wiring being a\\\\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (iesd).\\\\n\\\\n4.  on april 26, cruise science memory readouts (mro) were performed for the\\\\nextreme ultraviolet spectrometer (euv), dust detector (dds), and magnetometer\\\\n(mag) instruments.  preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\\\nproperly.\\\\n\\\\n5.  during the period from april 26 to april 27, a navigation cycle was\\\\nperformed.  this navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\\\\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\\\\nspacecraft over dss-63, dss-14, and dss-43.\\\\n\\\\n6.  on april 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the radio relay\\\\nantenna (rra) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on april 28.\\\\nthe rra was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\\\\n20.3 degrees.  preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\\\\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  the rra was commanded back\\\\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  preliminary analysis indicated the\\\\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  the\\\\nrra motor temperature was at 1 degree c at the start of the activity and had\\\\nincreased to 1.6 degrees c at its completion.\\\\n\\\\n     after verifying proper rra slewing, the rra slew test mini-sequence was\\\\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on april 28.  upon successful uplink,\\\\na delayed action command (dac) was sent which will reposition the stator on\\\\nmay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  also, a dac was sent to turn the\\\\ntwo-way noncoherent (twnc) on april 28 prior to the start of the rra slew test\\\\nmini-sequence.\\\\n\\\\n7.  on april 27, a no-op command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\\\n\\\\n8.  on april 28, the rra slew test executed nominally.  the spacecraft under\\\\nstored sequence control performed six rra slews starting at about 16 degrees\\\\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\\\\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  all of\\\\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  the rra motor temperature was\\\\nat 2.3 degrees c at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\\\\ndegrees c at its completion.  after completion of the rra slews, real-time\\\\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\\\\n\\\\n9.  the ac/dc bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\\\\n(greater than 25 dn) throughout this period.  the ac measurement reads 17 dn\\\\n(3.9 volts).  the dc measurement reads 134 dn (15.7 volts).  these\\\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the ac/dc special\\\\nanomaly team.\\\\n\\\\n10. the spacecraft status as of april 29, 1993, is as follows:\\\\n\\\\n       a)  system power margin -  75 watts\\\\n       b)  spin configuration - dual-spin\\\\n       c)  spin rate/sensor - 3.15rpm/star scanner\\\\n       d)  spacecraft attitude is approximately 23 degrees\\\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\\\\n       e)  downlink telemetry

command system (cmd) took\\\\nplace april 27, 1993 with dss-61 (madrid 34 meter antenna).  the test went\\\\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new dsn\\\\n(deep space network) group 5 command processor assembly (cpa).  the test was\\\\nsuccessful and the next test for v18.0 cmd is scheduled for may 1, 1993 with\\\\ndss-15 (goldstone 34 meter

range.\\\\n> \\\\n\\\\nfor the purpose of a contest, i\\\\\\'d bet some things could be cut.  like fuel\\\\nfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  even still, if the\\\\ncontest participants had to fund dc-1 development, it probably wouldn\\\\\\'t be\\\\nworth it to develop dc-1 (just for the contest).  just give me the cheapest\\\\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so gs) booster...  if i\\\\ndon\\\\\\'t have to pay for dc-1 development, great!, i\\\\\\'ll use it.\\\\n\\\\nbut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in aw&st about a\\\\nlow cost (it\\\\\\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  a general\\\\ndynamics scheme involving a titan iv & shuttle to lift a centaur upper\\\\nstage, lev, and crew capsule.  the mission consists of delivering two\\\\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \\\\ntotal cost:  us was $10-$13 billion.  joint esa(?)/nasa project was $6-$9\\\\nbillion for the us share.\\\\n\\\\ni didn\\\\\\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but i\\\\\\'d bet that\\\\nits  around 30 days.  and the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\\\\ntonnes.  so if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\\\\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\\\\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\\\\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\\\\nthat\\\\\\'s a wild ass guess).  a pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\\\\neats up a bit of lox.  and i\\\\\\'m not certain if a home brewed (or\\\\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  but let\\\\\\'s round\\\\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the gd plan talks about 9.7 ton\\\\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  this adds up to two centaurs, two\\\\nlevs, two shuttle flights... all to put a single man on the moon for a\\\\nyear.   hmmm.  not really practical.  anyone got a cheaper/better way of\\\\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  anyone\\\\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year\\\\\\'s supply of consumables and\\\\nequipment would weigh?\\\\n\\\\nand i was wondering about the gd lev.  is it reusable?  or is it discarded\\\\nto burn up on return to leo?  if its not discarded, could it be refueled? \\\\nhenry: do you know anything about the gd lev?  i noted that it uses rl-10\\\\nengines.  aren\\\\\\'t they reusable/restartable?  would a lev fit in a dc-1? \\\\ni\\\\\\'ve forgotten (if i ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\\\\ndc-1.\\\\n\\\\nall in all, i\\\\\\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\\\\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  how about:  a prize for the first\\\\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\\\\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\\\\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  find\\\\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  having a single goal\\\\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\\\\nto win.  and for those that didn\\\\\\'t give up, i find something a little scary\\\\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  i\\\\\\'d\\\\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\\\\n\\\\nlastly, about ten or fifteen years back i seem to recall that there was an\\\\nenglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\\\\nthe cheap.  i recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human\\\\nbody produced, how much lunar material it\\\\\\'d need for protection from solar\\\\nflares, etc.  unfortunately i don\\\\\\'t remember the name of this magazine. \\\\ndoes this ring a bell to anyone?\\\\n\\\\ncraig keithley                    |\"i don\\\\\\'t remember, i

talks in the last month which might be of interest. i\\\\\\'ve \\\\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  since my note taking ability is by no means\\\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  permission is \\\\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\\\n\\\\nmichael sternberg, cheif of operations of rimsat, was invited to speak at an\\\\ninformal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois.\\\\nacdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control, disarmament and\\\\ninternational security.  rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the\\\\ncompany is using russian launchers and satellites.  i think it also helped that\\\\nhis daughter is a grad student in the international relations program.\\\\n\\\\nthe concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson (?) went to tonga\\\\nto visit a friend.  while he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\\\\nwho happened to be a big tv fan.  matt bought the king a satellite dish, which \\\\nthe king thought was really nifty.  since tonga has a gnp of about $70 million,\\\\nhis majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  matt thought\\\\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\\\\nsatellite slots.  while this isn\\\\\\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\\\\nseeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\\\\nslots.\\\\n\\\\nthe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl\\\\nhilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\\\\nsupporting tonga\\\\\\'s case.  eventually tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \\\\n70 e to 170 e (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\\\\naccording to sternberg, four of these, from 130 e to 142 e are the best in the\\\\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and \\\\nthe pacific rim. \\\\n\\\\nrimsat was formed to use these slots. it was officially formed in nevis as a tax\\\\nhaven.  they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\\\\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\\\\ncost approximately $2 billion.  it\\\\\\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\\\\neventually, they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware.  they began \\\\nnegotiating with glavkosmos for hardware.  mr sternberg describes operating in \\\\nmoscow in such harsh terms that i don\\\\\\'t think i\\\\\\'ll visit there for a long time.\\\\nbesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\\\\nthat people operate.  for example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \\\\neveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\\\\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\\\\n\\\\neventually, rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\\\\nof $150 million.  however, glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  sternberg\\\\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who \\\\nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  since glavkosmos was\\\\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  he\\\\nagain described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  eventually,\\\\nhe worked out a deal and on dec 4, 1992 he met with koptev, who heads the \\\\nrussian space program, to sign the deal.  koptev insisted on a few concessions\\\\nbefore signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to \\\\nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat.\\\\n\\\\nthe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, npo applied \\\\nmechanics -- npo pm to use their acronym.  this organization is located in \\\\nsiberia (can\\\\\\'t figure out how to spell the town, i need an atlas) and has built\\\\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  sternberg commented that\\\\nsiberians are very different from musovites.  they are hard workers, honest\\\\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  at this\\\\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\\\\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\\\\n\\\\nsternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm.  his company is \\\\napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.it apparently costs the russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\\\\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  if you want to give them \\\\nspecifications, they\\\\\\'ll build you a satellite.  for the particular satellites\\\\nthat rimsat will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  this\\\\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the u.s.  they can sell their time for about $1.1\\\\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the u.s.  rimsat will launch their \\\\nsatellites on protons.  to get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  they \\\\nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift i can give\\\\nyou their address.  the first launch is scheduled for october and they are\\\\ngetting one used satellite from the russians, which is being moved into place\\\\nnow.\\\\n\\\\ntidbits:\\\\n\\\\n*  sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\\\\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\\\\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\\\\n\\\\n*  russian launches are self insured.  the promise to replace a failed launch\\\\nwithin 9 months.\\\\n\\\\n*  major investors in rimsat include russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\\\\nfund organization, cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast asia,\\\\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in u.s aerospace which he says is\\\\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\\\\n\\\\n*  he downplayed the instabilites in the ex-ussr saying that we are worried\\\\npartly because we aren\\\\\\'t used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying\\\\nmonolith.  italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don\\\\\\'t worry \\\\nbecause we\\\\\\'re used to it.  he predicted that once we get used to seeing what\\\\nreally goes on in russia we won\\\\\\'t worry about their stability as much.\\\\n\\\\n*  part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\\\\nmoney.  the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\\\\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \\\\nrubles.  to get around this, rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian\\\\nbank account.  npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\\\\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\\\\n\\\\n*  one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western \\\\nsatellite industry.  however, intelsat recently bought three of the same type\\\\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\\\\n\\\\n*  the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\\\\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  the older gorizont (horizon) satellites have\\\\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern express satellites compare\\\\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  while this is much \\\\nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, sternberg downplayed the \\\\ndifference.  at these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  in addition,\\\\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\\\\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\\\\nhardware.\\\\n\\\\n-- \\\\njosh hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t    \"find a way or make

kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\\\nkeywords: sirtf, jpl\\\\nnews-software: vax/vms vnews 1.41    \\\\n\\\\nfrom the \"jpl universe\"\\\\napril 23, 1993\\\\n\\\\nsirtf is still very much in business\\\\n\\\\nby mark whalen\\\\n     in these times of extra-tight nasa budgets, the very\\\\nsurvival of a number of missions has been uncertain. but thanks\\\\nto major design refinements implemented in recent months, jpl\\\\\\'s\\\\nspace infrared telescope facility (sirtf) -- a major project\\\\nconsidered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is \"alive\\\\nand well,\" according to project scientist michael werner.\\\\n     a lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission have\\\\nadded up to a less expensive project with \"tremendous scientific\\\\npower\" and a bright future, said werner.\\\\n     designed as a follow-up to the highly successful infrared\\\\nastronomical satellite (iras) and cosmic background explorer\\\\n(cobe) missions, sirtf -- a cryogenically cooled observatory for\\\\ninfrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000\\\\nor 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.\\\\n     iras\\\\\\' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10\\\\nyears ago allowed astronomers to view the milky way as never\\\\nbefore and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25\\\\ncomets. it provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive than\\\\nany previously available from ground-based observations. cobe has\\\\nmeasured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large\\\\nangular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.\\\\n     but to illuminate sirtf\\\\\\'s potential, jim evans, jpl\\\\\\'s\\\\nmanager of astrophysics and fundamental physics pre-projects,\\\\nrecently said that the project is \"1,000 to 1 million times more\\\\ncapable than iras,\" based on technological advances in infrared\\\\ndetector arrays.\\\\n     however, despite the enormous strides in infrared\\\\nexploration sirtf promised, and the fact that it was cited as the\\\\nhighest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s\\\\n(by the national academy of sciences), it took a \"diet or die\"\\\\ndirective from nasa headquarters last year to keep the project\\\\ngoing, according to werner.\\\\n     the project is now known as atlas sirtf, based on the key\\\\nfactor in its new design: the satellite will orbit the sun\\\\ninstead of the earth, permitting the use of an atlas rocket\\\\nlaunch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier titan. \"the\\\\nmain advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your\\\\nlaunch capability for boosting the payload -- you don\\\\\\'t have to\\\\ncarry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit,\" werner said.\\\\nthe other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that \"it\\\\\\'s in a\\\\nbetter thermal environment, away from the heat of the earth.\"\\\\n     additional major changes in sirtf\\\\\\'s redesign include\\\\nshortening the mission from five to three years and building a\\\\nspacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original\\\\nplan -- atlas sirtf will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds)\\\\ncompared to titan sirtf\\\\\\'s 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).\\\\n     all of that adds up to \"a less stressful launch\\\\nenvironment,\" werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200\\\\nmillion for the launch, in addition to increased savings in the\\\\ndesign of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.\\\\n     werner said sirtf\\\\\\'s redesign came as a result of congress\\\\\\'\\\\ntelling nasa \"you\\\\\\'re trying to do too many things. if you want us\\\\nto support sirtf, which is a good project, develop a plan to see\\\\nhow it fits into (nasa\\\\\\'s) overall strategy.\"\\\\n     shortly thereafter, sirtf was named as nasa\\\\\\'s highest\\\\npriority \"flagship\" scientific mission by the interdisciplinary\\\\nspace sciences advisory committee, in addition to the blessing\\\\nfrom the national academy of sciences.\\\\n     while the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping\\\\nto keep the project alive, sirtf\\\\\\'s major scientific contribution\\\\nalways promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector\\\\narrays, which will allow images to be developed \"tens of\\\\nthousands of times faster\" than before, according to evans.\\\\n     \"up until a couple of years ago,\" werner said, \"all infrared\\\\nastronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays\\\\nof individually assembled detectors. since then, the department\\\\nof defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or\\\\nhundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, and\\\\nthose are very well suited for use on sirtf.\"\\\\n     werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget\\\\npressures, congress is currently watching nasa projects with an\\\\neye out for any \"technological spinoff.\"\\\\n     \"on that question, i think we have some things to say,\" he\\\\nsaid, \"because the detectors we\\\\\\'re using are straight off various\\\\nmilitary developments. also, sirtf will be built by the u.s.\\\\naerospace industry, and it\\\\\\'s a real technological and engineering\\\\nchallenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.\\\\n     \"sirtf will be used by the entire astronomical community,\"\\\\nwerner added, but the revised three-year mission \"puts a premium\\\\non observing time. we have to educate the user community and\\\\ndevelop a program that involves early surveys and quick\\\\nturnaround of the data.\"\\\\n     werner said the downsizing of the project required a\\\\nreduction in scope and complexity of sirtf\\\\\\'s three instruments --\\\\nthe infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multiband\\\\nimaging photometer. however, these reductions will only result in\\\\nlosses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.\\\\n     the project hopes to start a \"phase b\" activity in 1995,\\\\nwhich will provide a detailed concept for development and design.\\\\nbuilding the hardware would begin about two years later.\\\\n     projected cost estimates, evans said, are $850 million-$950\\\\nmillion.\\\\n     \"i am very optimistic about sirtf,\" he said. \"it will\\\\nprovide a tremendous return for the investment.\"\\\\n     werner added that an additional benefit from the project\\\\nwill be the \"enrichment of our intellectual and cultural\\\\nenvironment. people on the street are very interested in\\\\nastronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on other\\\\nplanets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind of\\\\nquestions sirtf will help answer.\"\\\\n                              ###\\\\n

texas\\\\n\\\\n    announcement for mission specialist and pilot astronaut candidates\\\\n    ==================================================================\\\\n\\\\n    astronaut candidate program\\\\n    ---------------------------\\\\n\\\\n    the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) has a need for\\\\n    pilot astronaut candidates and mission specialist astronaut candidates\\\\n    to support the space shuttle program. nasa is now accepting on a\\\\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\\\\n\\\\n    persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\\\\n    considered.\\\\n\\\\n    all positions are located at the lyndon b. johnson space center in\\\\n    houston, texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\\\\n    program.\\\\n\\\\n    space shuttle program description\\\\n    ---------------------------------\\\\n\\\\n    the numerous successful flights of the space shuttle have demonstrated\\\\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\\\\n    routine. the space shuttle orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\\\\n    the earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. it then\\\\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\\\\n    flight crew.\\\\n\\\\n    the orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\\\\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\\\\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\\\\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. these missions will\\\\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\\\\n    station. the orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\\\\n    orbits than can be achieved by the orbiter itself. users of the space\\\\n    shuttle\\\\\\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\\\\n    government agencies and private industries.\\\\n\\\\n    the crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\\\\n    and three mission specialists. on occasion additional crew members are\\\\n    assigned. the commander, pilot, and mission specialists are nasa\\\\n    astronauts.\\\\n\\\\n    pilot astronaut\\\\n\\\\n    pilot astronauts server as both space shuttle commanders and pilots.\\\\n    during flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\\\\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. the pilot assists the\\\\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. in addition, the\\\\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\\\\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\\\\n    payload operations.\\\\n\\\\n    mission specialist astronaut\\\\n\\\\n    mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\\\\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of shuttle operations\\\\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\\\\n    experiment and payload operations. mission specialists are required to\\\\n    have a detailed knowledge of shuttle systems, as well as detailed\\\\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\\\\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\\\\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. mission\\\\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\\\\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\\\\n    experimental operations.\\\\n\\\\n    astronaut candidate program\\\\n    ===========================\\\\n\\\\n    basic

   citizenship requirements\\\\n\\\\n    applications for the astronaut candidate program must be citizens of\\\\n    the united states.\\\\n\\\\n    note on academic requirements\\\\n\\\\n    applicants for the astronaut candidate program must meet the basic\\\\n    education requirements for nasa engineering and scientific positions --\\\\n    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum\\\\n    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor\\\\\\'s\\\\n    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,\\\\n    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.\\\\n\\\\n      the following degree fields, while related to engineering and the\\\\n    sciences, are not considered qualifying:\\\\n      - degrees in technology (engineering technology, aviation technology,\\\\n\\\\tmedical technology, etc.)\\\\n      - degrees in psychology (except for clinical psychology,

be accepted on a continuous basis. when nasa\\\\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\\\\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\\\\n    made. applications received after that date will be retained and\\\\n    considered for the next selection. applicants will be notified annually\\\\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\\\\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. those applicants\\\\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\\\\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. after the\\\\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\\\\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\\\\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\\\\n\\\\n    active duty military\\\\n\\\\n    active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\\\\n    respective military service and not directly to nasa. application\\\\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\\\\n\\\\n    selection\\\\n    ---------\\\\n\\\\n    personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\\\\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\\\\n    once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\\\\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\\\\n\\\\n    selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\\\\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\\\\n    their establishment.\\\\n\\\\n    general program requirements\\\\n\\\\n    selected applicants will be designated astronaut candidates and will be\\\\n    assigned to the astronaut office at the johnson space center, houston,\\\\n    texas. the astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\\\\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\\\\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\\\\n    ongoing programs. they will also participate in the basic astronaut\\\\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\\\\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. pilot\\\\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in nasa aircraft during\\\\n    their candidate period.\\\\n\\\\n    applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\\\\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. final selection as an astronaut\\\\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\\\\n    evaluation period. civilian candidates who successfully complete the\\\\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\\\\n    permanent federal employees and will be expected to remain with nasa for\\\\n    a period of at least five years. civilian candidates who are not\\\\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within nasa\\\\n    depending upon agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\\\\n    time. successful military candidates will be detailed to nasa for a\\\\n    specified tour of duty.\\\\n\\\\n    nasa has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\\\\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\\\\n    therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\\\\n\\\\n    pay and benefits\\\\n    ----------------\\\\n\\\\n    civilians\\\\n\\\\n    salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the federal\\\\n    governments general schedule pay scales for grades gs-11 through gs-14,\\\\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\\\\n    and experience.\\\\n\\\\n    other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\\\\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\\\\n\\\\n    military\\\\n\\\\n    selected military personnel will be detailed to the johnson space center\\\\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\\\\n    other similar

mentioned below\\\\n    would be welcome. sources: nasa fact sheets, cassini mission design\\\\n    team, isas/nasda launch schedules, press kits.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    asuka (astro-d) - isas (japan) x-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\\\n    earth orbit on 2/20/93. equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\\\n    angstrom) x-ray telescope, x-ray ccd cameras, and imaging gas\\\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    cassini - saturn orbiter and titan atmosphere probe. cassini is a joint\\\\n    nasa/esa project designed to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian\\\\n    system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe. cassini\\\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a titan iv/centaur in october of 1997.\\\\n    after gravity assists of venus, earth and jupiter in a vvejga\\\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004. upon\\\\n    arrival, the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\\\n    orbit around saturn. near the end of this initial orbit, the huygens\\\\n    probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\\\n    titan. the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about 3 hours\\\\n    while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\\\n    surface. after the completion of the probe mission, the orbiter\\\\n    continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years. titan\\\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of titan and\\\\n    targeted flybys of iapetus, dione and enceladus. the objectives of the\\\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of saturn\\\\\\'s atmosphere,\\\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of saturn\\\\\\'s\\\\n    satellites, and characterize titan\\\\\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\\\n\\\\n    one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its\\\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. these\\\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\\\n    down onto the surface. the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\\\n    peer through titan\\\\\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\\\n    surface. experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\\\n\\\\n    the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini (1625-1712), the\\\\n    first director of the paris observatory, who discovered several of\\\\n    saturn\\\\\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. the titan\\\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan\\\\n    huygens (1629-1695), who discovered titan and first described the true\\\\n    nature of saturn\\\\\\'s rings.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t key scheduled dates for the cassini

radar mapping mission. has mapped almost the entire\\\\n    surface at high resolution. currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity\\\\n    map.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    mars observer - mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.\\\\n    launched 9/25/92 on a titan iii/tos booster. mo is currently (4/93) in\\\\n    transit to mars, arriving on 8/24/93. operations will start 11/93 for\\\\n    one martian year (687 days).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    topex/poseidon - joint us/french earth observing satellite, launched\\\\n    8/10/92 on an ariane 4 booster. the primary objective of the\\\\n    topex/poseidon project is to make precise and accurate global\\\\n    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially\\\\n    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. the satellite also\\\\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    ulysses- european space agency probe to study the sun from an orbit over\\\\n    its poles. launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\\\n\\\\n    since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send ulysses far out of\\\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\\\n    that planet by sliding over jupiter\\\\\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\\\n    manuver in february 1992. this bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. it will pass over the sun\\\\\\'s south pole\\\\n    in the summer of 1993. its aphelion is 5.2 au, and, surprisingly, its\\\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 au-- that\\\\\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\\\n    that\\\\\\'s always further from the sun than the earth is!\\\\n\\\\n    while in jupiter\\\\\\'s neigborhood, ulysses studied the magnetic and\\\\n    radiation environment. for a short summary of these results, see\\\\n    *science*, v. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 september 1992). for gory technical\\\\n    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    other space science missions (note: this is based on a posting by ron\\\\n    baalke in 11/89, with isas/nasda information contributed by yoshiro\\\\n    yamada

\"biological transmutations\" by louis \\\\n          kervran, [1972 edition is best.], and in chapter 17 of the \\\\n          book \"the secret life of plants\" by peter tompkins and \\\\n          christopher bird, 1973: \\\\n\\\\n               (1) obtain a good sample of plant seeds, all of the same \\\\n                   kind.  [some kinds might work better that others.]\\\\n\\\\n               (2) divide the sample into two groups of equal weight \\\\n                   and number.\\\\n\\\\n               (3) sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper \\\\n                   for three or four weeks.\\\\n\\\\n               (4) separately incinerate both groups.\\\\n\\\\n               (5) weigh the residue from each group.  [the residue of \\\\n                   the sprouted group will usually weigh at least \\\\n                   several percent more than the other group.]\\\\n\\\\n               (6) analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for \\\\n                   mineral content.

82\\\\n\\\\n   two developments have brought these type of activities back to\\\\nthe forefront in 1993.  first, in february, the russians deployed a\\\\n20-m reflector from a progress vehicle after it had departed from\\\\nthe mir space station.  while this \"banner\" reflector was blank,\\\\nnpo energia was very active in reporting that future  banner\\\\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\\\\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the banner in a tv\\\\ncommercial, as filmed from the mir.\\\\n   the second development, has been that space marketing inc, the\\\\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the conestoga\\\\nbooster and comet spacecraft, is now pushing the \"environmental\\\\nbillboard\".  as laid out by smi chief engineer dr ron humble of the\\\\nuniversity of colorado space laboratory and preston carter of the\\\\nlawrence livermore national laboratory, the \"environmental\\\\nbillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\\\\n804x1609 meters.  advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\\\\ndeployed by the inflatable \\\\\\'frame\\\\\\'.\\\\n   to help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\\\\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\\\\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the earth\\\\\\'s\\\\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to mike lawson, head of\\\\nsmi. furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\\\\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the earth\\\\\\'s\\\\natmosphere. according to imi, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\\\\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\\\\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" the remaining spacecraft will monitor\\\\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\\\\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\\\\n   this would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\\\\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  but smi\\\\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5x that of the people who\\\\nwatched the superbowl, where a 30-second advertising \\\\\\'unit\\\\\\' cost\\\\n$600,000.  since smi is located in atlanta, georgia, it is being\\\\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\\\\nsummer olympics in atlanta.\\\\n  \\\\nbut back to brian\\\\\\'s questions:\\\\n>and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn\\\\n>news blip?  how serious is this project?  is this just in the \"wild\\\\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\\\\n  \\\\n    see above. as for serious -- if they can get $15-20 m or so (my\\\\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\\\\n$10-15 m for a launch), then it\\\\\\'s probably real.  they are claiming to\\\\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\\\\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\\\\\\'t piggy back upon\\\\nsomeone else\\\\\\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\\\\nlaunch.  that\\\\\\'s a $10-15 m cost they need to raise, right there.\\\\n    and there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\\\\nwell.  note there is one potential legal challenge to smi on the use\\\\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  while i don\\\\\\'t think the\\\\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, i am an amateur astronomer,\\\\nand no, i don\\\\\\'t really like the idea of this additional light\\\\npollution, but i know of no prohibition of

north pole!\\\\n\\\\n        on june 2 and 7, 1983, two of the soviet union\\\\\\'s mighty proton \\\\n    rockets lifted off from the tyuratam space center in the kazakhstan \\\\n    republic.  aboard those boosters were a new breed of venera probe \\\\n    for the planet venus. \\\\n\\\\n        designated venera 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\\\\n    yet more spherical craft on the venerean surface but to radar map the\\\\n    planet in detail from orbit.  to accomplish this task, the basic\\\\n    venera design was modified in numerous areas.  the central bus core\\\\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\\\\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\\\\n    the venera 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  extra solar panels\\\\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\\\\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  the\\\\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \\\\n    to properly transmit this information to earth. \\\\n\\\\n        atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\\\\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\\\\n    polyus v side-looking radar antennae.  the radar system, possibly a\\\\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \\\\n    the soviets for earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map venus\\\\\\'\\\\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \\\\n\\\\n        the soviet probes\\\\\\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\\\\n    the united states pioneer venus orbiter, which could reveal objects \\\\n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  and while the\\\\n    veneras\\\\\\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \\\\n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) arecibo radio telescope on the \\\\n    island of puerto rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\\\\n    pole of venus.  this region was unobtainable by either arecibo or \\\\n    pioneer venus and appeared to contain a number of potentially \\\\n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\\\\n\\\\n        on october 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \\\\n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \\\\n    venera 15 fired its braking rockets over venus to place itself in a \\\\n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \\\\n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  venera \\\\n    16 followed suit four days later.  the twin probes thus became venus\\\\\\' \\\\n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\\\\n\\\\n        radar operations began on october 16 for venera 15 and october 20 \\\\n    for venera 16.  for up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\\\\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \\\\n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \\\\n    the craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \\\\n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \\\\n    to two large soviet antennae on earth.  each strip of information took \\\\n    eight hours to process by computer.  by the end of their main missions \\\\n    in july of 1984, the veneras had mapped 115 million square kilometers \\\\n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\\\\n\\\\n        venera 15 and 16 revealed that venus has a surface geology more\\\\n    complex than shown by pioneer venus in the late 1970s.  numerous hills, \\\\n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \\\\n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \\\\n    last one billion years.  in planetary terms this makes the venerean \\\\n    surface rather young.  hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \\\\n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \\\\n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \\\\n    across, due to venus\\\\\\' very dense atmosphere.\\\\n\\\\n        there were some disagreements between u.s. and soviet scientists\\\\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  for example, the probes\\\\\\' \\\\n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \\\\n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high maxwell montes, the tallest \\\\n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  american \\\\n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that maxwell \\\\n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of ishtar terra.  \\\\n\\\\n        in any event, the u.s. decided to wait on making verdicts about\\\\n    venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\\\\n    in the decade.  originally named the venus orbiting imaging radar\\\\n    (voir), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\\\\n    nated the venus radar mapper (vrm).  eventually the machine would be \\\\n    called magellan, after the portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan \\\\n    (circa 1480-1521).  this vehicle would map the entire planet in even \\\\n    finer detail than the veneras.  for the time, however, the soviet \\\\n    probes maintained that distinction.\\\\n\\\\n        radar imaging was not the only ability of the veneras.  bolted\\\\n    next to the polyus v radar antenna were the omega altimeter and the \\\\n    fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\\\\\\'s\\\\n    temperatures.  the majority of the areas covered registered about\\\\n    five hundred degrees celsius (932 degrees fahrenheit), but a few\\\\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \\\\n    current volcanic activity.  the probes also found that the clouds \\\\n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \\\\n    lower than at the equator.  in contrast, the polar air above sixty \\\\n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \\\\n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\\\\n\\\\n        when the main mapping mission ended in july of 1984, there were \\\\n    plans for at least one of the veneras to radar image the surface at \\\\n    more southernly latitudes.  unfortunately this idea did not come to \\\\n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\\\\n    gas to perform the operation.  \\\\n\\\\n        venera 15 and 16 ceased transmission in march of 1985, leaving \\\\n    the soviet institute of radiotechnology and electronics with six \\\\n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \\\\n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of venus.\\\\n\\\\n        venus by balloon\\\\n\\\\n        for years the thick atmosphere of venus had been a tempting \\\\n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\\\\\\'s mantle of \\\\n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  professor jacques blamont of \\\\n    the french space agency centre national d\\\\\\'etudes spatiales (cnes)\\\\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \\\\n    french-soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  nevertheless, \\\\n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\\\\n\\\\n        when two proton rockets were sent skyward on december 15 and 21, \\\\n    the soviet union provided western observers with the first clear, full \\\\n    views of the booster which had been launching every soviet venus probe \\\\n    since 1975.  this was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\\\\n\\\\n        the unmanned probes launched into space that december were named\\\\n    vega 1 and 2, a contraction of the words venera and gallei - gallei\\\\n    being the russian word for halley.  not only did the spacecraft \\\\n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \\\\n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet halley.  \\\\n\\\\n        this famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \\\\n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\\\\n    since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\\\\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \\\\n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \\\\n    bodies which actually come close to earth.  \\\\n\\\\n        most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \\\\n    system.  some, like halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \\\\n    in towards the sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \\\\n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \\\\n    encounter.\\\\n\\\\n        the soviet union, along with the european space agency (esa) and\\\\n    japan\\\\\\'s institute of space and astronautical science (isas), did not\\\\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\\\\n    close examination of halley.  the esa would be using the cylindrical\\\\n    giotto probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \\\\n    comet, while japan\\\\\\'s first deep space craft - sakigake (pioneer) and \\\\n    suisei (comet) - would view halley from a much safer distance. \\\\n\\\\n        scientists in the united states also desired to study the comet\\\\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\\\\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  however, government budget\\\\n    cuts to nasa canceled the american efforts.  the u.s. would have to\\\\n    make do primarily with earth-based observations and the sharing of \\\\n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the dust counter \\\\n    and mass analyzer (ducma), designed by chicago university professor \\\\n    john simpson, was added on the soviet mission in may of 1984.\\\\n\\\\n        the soviets\\\\\\' answer to halley were the vegas.  instead of building\\\\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the soviets decided to modify\\\\n    their venera bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \\\\n    advanced venus mission along the way.  as vega 1 and 2 reached venus,\\\\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \\\\n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet halley, much as the \\\\n    u.s. probe mariner 10 used venus to flyby mercury eleven years earlier. \\\\n    the soviet craft would then head on to halley, helping to pinpoint the \\\\n    location of the comet\\\\\\'s erupting nucleus for the giotto probe to dive \\\\n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in march of 1986.\\\\n\\\\n        as planned, the two vegas arrived at venus in june of 1985.  vega\\\\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\\\\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  the craft touched the\\\\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of june 11.  sixty-one kilometers\\\\n    (36.6 miles) above the venerean surface a small container was released\\\\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\\\\n    altitude.  thus the first balloon probe ever to explore venus had\\\\n    successfully arrived. \\\\n\\\\n        one kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\\\\n    pumped into the teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\\\\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  dangling on a tether thirteen\\\\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\\\\n    an aerostat.  the top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\\\\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\\\\n    point to the balloon.  beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\\\\n    and instruments.  connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\\\\n    measuring cloud particles.  the aerostat was painted with a special\\\\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\\\\n    permeated the planet\\\\\\'s atmosphere. \\\\n\\\\n        the vega 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of venus just\\\\n    north of the equator.  scientists were concerned that the gas bag \\\\n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \\\\n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \\\\n    this action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \\\\n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \\\\n    the author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \\\\n    to the ones attached to venera 9 and 10 in 1975, when soviet scientists \\\\n    had thought the planet\\\\\\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \\\\n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\\\\n\\\\n        the first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\\\\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\\\\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  the threat of bursting in the day heat did\\\\n    not materialize.  the vega 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\\\\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\\\\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\\\\n    main cloud layers reported by pioneer venus in 1978.  indeed the\\\\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\\\\n    (150 miles) per hour.  strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\\\\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\\\\n    journey.  the layer\\\\\\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees celsius\\\\n    (104 degrees fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 earth atmosphere.\\\\n    the nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \\\\n\\\\n        early in the first balloon\\\\\\'s flight, the vega 1 lander was already\\\\n    headed towards the venerean surface.  both landers were equipped with\\\\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on venera 13 \\\\n    and 14 in 1982.  however, vega 1 would become unable to report the\\\\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in rusalka planitia, the\\\\n    mermaid plain north of aphrodite terra.  while still ten to fifteen\\\\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \\\\n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \\\\n    miles) above the surface. \\\\n\\\\n        there was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\\\\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  this was unfortunate not\\\\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\\\\n    venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \\\\n    before been directly examined.  nevertheless, the surface temperature \\\\n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees celsius (874.4 degrees \\\\n    fahrenheit) and 95 earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\\\\\\'s \\\\n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  a large amount of background \\\\n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\\\\n\\\\n        as had been done when the drills and cameras on venera 11 and \\\\n    12 had failed in december of 1978, the soviets focused on the data\\\\n    returned during the lander\\\\\\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  the\\\\n    french-soviet malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \\\\n    and possibly phosphorus.  it is the sulfur - possibly from active \\\\n    volcanoes - which gives the venerean clouds their yellowish color.\\\\n    the sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\\\\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\\\\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\\\\n\\\\n        the vega 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \\\\n    appeared to be at odds with the information from pioneer venus.\\\\n    the case was made even stronger by the fact that vega 2\\\\\\'s results\\\\n    nearly matched its twin.  the vegas found only two main cloud layers \\\\n    instead of the three reported by the u.s. probes.  the layers were \\\\n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \\\\n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  the clouds persisted like a\\\\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \\\\n    much lower than the pv readings.  one possibility for the discrepan-\\\\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the venerean air \\\\n    over the last seven years.\\\\n\\\\n        when the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \\\\n    functioning part of the vega 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\\\\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\\\\n    the sun to become the first probe to meet comet halley.  on march\\\\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \\\\n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\\\\n    the soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\\\\n    bodies with one space vessel.\\\\n\\\\n        on june 13, vega 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\\\\n    a two-day fall towards venus.  like its duplicate, the vega 2\\\\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\\\\n    it on earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\\\\n    side of the planet.  during its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\\\\n    flight over venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\\\\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\\\\n    after 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \\\\n    for a further eight hours.  when the balloon passed over a five-\\\\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of aphrodite \\\\n    terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \\\\n    miles) towards the surface.\\\\n\\\\n        temperature sensors on the vega 2 balloon reported that the air \\\\n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees celsius \\\\n    (43.7 degrees fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the vega 1\\\\n    balloon.  this was corroborated by the vega 2 lander as it passed \\\\n    through the balloon\\\\\\'s level.  no positive indications of lightning\\\\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\\\\\\'s nephelometer \\\\n    failed to function.\\\\n\\\\n        the vega 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of aphrodite\\\\n    terra\\\\\\'s western arm on the fifteenth of june, 1,500 kilometers (900\\\\n    miles) southeast of vega 1.  the lander\\\\\\'s resting place was smoother\\\\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\\\\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  the soil drill was in\\\\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \\\\n    rare on earth but present in luna\\\\\\'s highlands.  this rock is rich in \\\\n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  a high degree \\\\n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  the air around vega 2 measured \\\\n    463 degrees celsius (865.4 degrees fahrenheit) and 91 earth atmospheres,\\\\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on venus.\\\\n\\\\n        far above the vega 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past venus at\\\\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \\\\n    to comet halley, making a closer flyby on march 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \\\\n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  both probes helped to reveal that the comet \\\\n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \\\\n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \\\\n    hours.\\\\n\\\\n        since both vega craft were still functioning after their halley\\\\n    encounters, soviet scientists considered an option to send the \\\\n    probes to other celestial objects.  one prime target was the near-\\\\n    earth planetoid 2101 adonis, which vega 2 could pass at a distance \\\\n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  sadly, the soviets \\\\n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \\\\n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \\\\n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach adonis as planned.  \\\\n    vega 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\\\\n\\\\n        future plans diverted\\\\n\\\\n        the impressive vega mission had given some scientists numerous \\\\n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \\\\n    world from the sun.  one example was the vesta mission, planned for\\\\n    the early 1990s.\\\\n\\\\n        this soviet-french collaboration called for the launch of multiple \\\\n    probes on a single proton rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  the craft \\\\n    would first swing by venus and drop off several landers and balloon \\\\n    probes.  the aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\\\\\\'s \\\\n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \\\\n    the vega balloons\\\\\\' two days.  the mission would then head out to \\\\n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \\\\n    landing on vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective main \\\\n    belt planetoid as seen from earth.\\\\n\\\\n        unfortunately for venus exploration, plans began to change in\\\\n    the soviet union.  in 1986 the soviets decided to reroute the vesta\\\\n    mission to the red planet mars instead of venus, keeping the comet\\\\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  by this time in the soviet space \\\\n    program interest was focusing on mars.  already under construction \\\\n    was an entirely new probe design called phobos.  two members of this \\\\n    class were planned to leave earth in 1988 and orbit mars the next \\\\n    year.  phobos 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\\\\n    mars\\\\\\' largest moon, phobos. \\\\n\\\\n        all this was a prelude to even more advanced mars expeditions,\\\\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \\\\n    eventually human explorers in the early twenty-first century.\\\\n    the environment of venus was just too hostile for any serious\\\\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\\\\n\\\\n        but things began to look bleak for soviet venus and mars\\\\n    exploration.  both phobos probes failed to complete their missions,\\\\n    one losing contact on the way to the red planet in 1988 and the other\\\\n    going silent in mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\\\\n    landing in march of 1989. \\\\n\\\\n        in 1989 a plan was devised for a venus orbiter to drop eight to\\\\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  several years later the\\\\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \\\\n    on indefinite hold.  no other official soviet missions to venus have\\\\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\\\\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \\\\n\\\\n        during the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\\\\n    was taking over the soviet union.  president mikhail gorbachev began \\\\n    to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \\\\n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the west.  while the \\\\n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \\\\n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".\\\\n\\\\n        these effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\\\\n    missions at all levels were cut back.  the soviets began making\\\\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\\\\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \\\\n    make money.  \\\\n\\\\n        in early 1992 it was reported that the soviets were offering for \\\\n    sale several fully-equipped veneras they had in storage for the price \\\\n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \\\\n    probe.  no nation took them up on the bargain.  meanwhile the united \\\\n    states was gearing up for new venus missions of their own.\\\\n\\\\n        magellan and galileo \\\\n\\\\n        the u.s. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\\\\n    with the launch of the space shuttle atlantis on may 4, 1989.\\\\n    aboard the shuttle was the magellan spacecraft, a combination of\\\\n    spare parts from other u.s. probes designed to make the most \\\\n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of venus in history.  when\\\\n    magellan reached the second world in august of 1990, it would be\\\\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\\\\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of venera 15 and 16.\\\\n\\\\n        in the interim another american probe was launched from a space \\\\n    shuttle which would make a quick flyby of venus on its way to orbit \\\\n    the giant planet jupiter in 1995.  on october 18, 1989, the shuttle \\\\n    atlantis released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \\\\n    named galileo after the famous italian astronomer who discovered the \\\\n    probe\\\\\\'s primary target\\\\\\'s major moons in 1610.\\\\n\\\\n        in the absence of a powerful enough booster to send galileo on\\\\n    a direct flight to the jovian planet, the probe was sent around\\\\n    venus and earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\\\\n    jupiter.  as a result, venus became galileo\\\\\\'s first planetary\\\\n    goal in february of 1990.  the probe radioed back images of the\\\\n    planet\\\\\\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\\\\n    that violent atmosphere.\\\\n\\\\n        on the drawing boards\\\\n\\\\n        with the incredible success of magellan in the last few years,\\\\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to venus.  scien-\\\\n    tists in the u.s. have talked to space scientists in the former soviet \\\\n    union - now the commonwealth of independent states since january 1, \\\\n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new venera lander missions \\\\n    within in the next decade.  japan, india, and the esa have also\\\\n    considered their own venus missions in the next few decades.\\\\n\\\\n        in february of 1993 nasa came up with several new venus projects \\\\n    as part of their discovery program for launching inexpensive probes\\\\n    throughout the solar system.  for venus two missions were selected\\\\n    for further study:  a venus multiprobe mission involving the landing\\\\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\\\\n    temperature, and pressure; and the venus composition probe, designed\\\\n    to study venus\\\\\\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\\\\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the soviets had done since 1967.\\\\n    final project decisions will be made in 1994.\\\\n\\\\n        humans on venus      \\\\n\\\\n        will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of venus?\\\\n    at present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\\\\n    would be threatening to any earth life not protected in something\\\\n    even tougher than a venera lander.  plans have been looked into\\\\n    changing the environment of venus itself into something more like\\\\n    earth\\\\\\'s.  however, it should be noted that any such undertaking\\\\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \\\\n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \\\\n    to speed up the planet\\\\\\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster\\\\n    than once every 243 earth days.  such a project may take centuries\\\\n    if not millennia.\\\\n\\\\n        in the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\\\\n    venus as its exists today.  we still have yet to fully know how\\\\n    a world so seemingly similar to earth in many important ways became\\\\n    instead such a deadly place.  will earth ever suffer this fate?\\\\n    perhaps venus holds the answers.  such answers may best be found\\\\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \\\\n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from venus.\\\\n\\\\n        bibliography -\\\\n\\\\n         barsukov, v. l., senior editor, venus geology, geochemistry, and \\\\n           geophysics:

by\\\\n>putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus, but so far\\\\n>space aliens are also mythical.]\\\\n\\\\nwell i won\\\\\\'t say flat out that they can\\\\\\'t be intelligent, but i\\\\\\'ll\\\\nbring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why i\\\\ndon\\\\\\'t think it\\\\\\'s likely. first let me say that when i say \"intelligent\"\\\\ni mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\\\\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. ie assuming\\\\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \\\\nit\\\\\\'s enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. that\\\\\\'s certainly not\\\\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\\\\nfor a putative technological alien.\\\\n\\\\nnow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\\\\nit\\\\\\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\\\\nof complexity. this is generally determined by the number of neuron\\\\ncells, and their interconnections. so a creature the size of a lemur\\\\nwouldn\\\\\\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. this argument\\\\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. there\\\\\\'s room\\\\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. one\\\\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. the electrochemical messages \\\\nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. this makes it difficult\\\\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\\\\nlarge creatures. so there\\\\\\'s little selection pressure for such brains.\\\\ninstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. this doesn\\\\\\'t rule out\\\\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\\\\n\\\\nthen there are the thermodynamic arguments. a tiny creature like the\\\\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it\\\\\\'s internal heat is rapidly\\\\nlost due to it\\\\\\'s high surface to volume ratio. i contend that a creature\\\\nthat must spend most of it\\\\\\'s time and energy feeding won\\\\\\'t have the time\\\\nto develop and exercise intelligence. that argument may be somewhat weak.\\\\nthe dinosaur\\\\\\'s problem is the reverse, it must moderate it\\\\\\'s heat production \\\\nbecause it\\\\\\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \\\\ni\\\\\\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\\\\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. so creatures would\\\\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\\\\nof humans if they are carbon based. that tends to rule out cold blooded\\\\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. some people contend that\\\\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. but for a creature\\\\nthe size of a brontosaur, it\\\\\\'s activity levels would have to be restrained\\\\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\\\\nwaste heat. whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\\\\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. i suspect that for intelligence\\\\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\\\\nenvironment is necessary. ie monkey curiousity. i doubt a large dinosaur\\\\nwould be capable of that much activity.\\\\n\\\\ngary\\\\n--

information concerning projects involving solar\\\\n> sails\\\\n\\\\ni was at an interesting seminar at work (uk\\\\\\'s r.a.l. space science\\\\ndept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale solar sail\\\\nproposed as a student space project. the guy giving the talk was keen to\\\\ngenerate interest in the project. i\\\\\\'ll typein the handout he gave out at\\\\nthe meeting. here goes : \\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tthe microlight solar sail\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t-------------------------\\\\n\\\\n1. introduction\\\\nthe solar sail is a well-established concept. harnessing the pressure of\\\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. in principle, such a\\\\nvehicle could explore the whole solar system with zero fuel consumption.\\\\n\\\\nhowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\\\npeople realize. the pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\\\\nsquare kilometer. deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\\\\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a \\\\\\'conventional\\\\\\' type\\\\nspacecraft is a daunting task. this is why, despite the potential of hte\\\\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\\\\n\\\\n2.design\\\\nrecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\\\\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\\\\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. several attitude control\\\\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\\\\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\\\\n\\\\nthe key components of the craft will be a minute ccd camera developed at\\\\nedinburgh university which can act as both attitude sensor and data\\\\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\\\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\\\\nof the sail itself. launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\\\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\\\\n\\\\n3.missions\\\\nthe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. for example:\\\\na) it could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the apollo or amor\\\\ngroups. closeup pictures could be transmitted back to earth at a low bit\\\\nrate.\\\\nb) it could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. previously unobserved\\\\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. by angling the sail to\\\\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\\\\nsunlight could be imaged. bright reflections would confirm that\\\\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\\\\nlocations.[immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\\\\nbase, btw]\\\\nc) it could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\\\\nnucleus. impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\\\\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\\\\ntube, like performing a biopsy. returning to earth, the sail acts as an\\\\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\\\\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\\\\ndeg c. the material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\\\\ncontainer.\\\\n\\\\ncontact: colin jack                              tel.

elevator to the top floor\\\\norganization: boeing ai center, huntsville, al\\\\nlines: 56\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nreading from a amoco performance products data sheet, their\\\\nerl-1906 resin with t40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive\\\\nstrength of 280,000 psi.  it has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\\\\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\\\\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\\\\nor 75 statute miles.\\\\n\\\\nnow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\\\\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\\\\nlet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \\\\nstrength.  this gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\\\\nsection column.  \\\\n\\\\na constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\\\\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\\\\nas you go up.  for example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\\\\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\\\\ncalculation).  this requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\\\\nsectional area to support the weight.  the mile of structure\\\\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \\\\nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\\\\n\\\\nthe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\\\\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  each mile\\\\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\\\\nto the bottom.  we can see from this that there is no theoretical\\\\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\\\\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\\\\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\\\\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\\\\n\\\\nlet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\\\\ncost.  with this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\\\\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  the $40/lb figure\\\\nis just for materials cost.  then we have a tower/payload mass\\\\nratio of 35.7:1.  at a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\\\\nheight becomes 111 miles.  this is clearly above the significant\\\\natmosphere.  a rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\\\\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\\\\nwill be almost eliminated.  g-losses are the component of\\\\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\\\\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  thus\\\\nthey represent wasted thrust.  together with drag, rockets starting\\\\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\\\\n\\\\nthis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\\\\nloads.  these will require more structural support over the first\\\\n15 miles of height.  above that, the air pressure drops to a low\\\\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\\\\n\\\\ndani eder\\\\n\\\\n-- \\\\ndani eder/meridian investment company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\\\nrt.1, box 188-2, athens al

(you can see the effects of this on any daytime\\\\n    launch.  the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the ssme exhaust is\\\\n    fluffy white steam.  watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\\\n    [orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [external tank side] of the stack.) the\\\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\\\n    basically the same way they were for the saturn v\\\\\\'s.  (a side note: the\\\\n    saturn v\\\\\\'s also had a roll program.  don\\\\\\'t ask me why -- i\\\\\\'m a shuttle\\\\n    guy.)\\\\n\\\\n    i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics.\\\\the added that the \"roll\\\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\\\n    the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\\\n    stated.  the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  the yaw\\\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  the total\\\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\\\n    array.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    how to receive the nasa tv channel, nasa select\\\\n\\\\n    nasa select is broadcast by satellite. if you have access to a satellite\\\\n    dish, you can find select on satcom f2r, transponder 13, c-band, 72\\\\n    degrees west longitude, audio 6.8, frequency 3960 mhz. f2r is stationed\\\\n    over the atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\\\n    california and points west. during events of special interest (e.g.\\\\n    shuttle missions), select is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\\\n    for these viewers.\\\\n\\\\n    if you can\\\\\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry select.\\\\n    it\\\\\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\\\\\'t.\\\\n\\\\n    the select schedule is found in the nasa headline news which is\\\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. generally it carries press\\\\n    conferences, briefings by nasa officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\\\n    missions and planetary encounters. select has recently begun carrying\\\\n    much more secondary material (associated with spacelink) when missions\\\\n    are not being covered.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    amateur radio frequencies for shuttle missions\\\\n\\\\n    the following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tw6fxn  -

is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.\\\\n\\\\nthis is a good question.  there are major blind spots in our understanding\\\\nof what makes the earth habitable.  for example, why does the earth\\\\\\'s\\\\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  the naive\\\\nanswer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.  photosynthesis\\\\nby itself can\\\\\\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\\\\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  what is needed\\\\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\\\\nthe resulting reduced material.\\\\n\\\\non earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\\\\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  however, this burial requires\\\\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\\\\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\\\\n\\\\nthis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\\\\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\\\\nan oxygen atmosphere.  in particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\\\\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\\\\n\\\\nthere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\\\\\\'s atmosphere\\\\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\\\\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric o2 to\\\\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  no convincing feedback\\\\nmechanism has been identified.  perhaps the reason is the weak\\\\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 myr or so, the oxygen\\\\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn\\\\\\'t be here to be wondering about\\\\nit.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tpaul f.

burst (except to say \"it\\\\\\'s somewhere in the field of view.\").  with\\\\ntwo detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector\\\\nto narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  with three detectors,\\\\none gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  if one of these\\\\nlocations is impossible (because, say, the earth blocked that part of the

looking at anything beyond the high speed civil transport, such\\\\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will boeing compete\\\\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\\\\nby mcdonnell douglass?\\\\n\\\\nwell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\\\\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\\\\npart first.\\\\n\\\\nthis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\\\\n\\\\nas far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\\\\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \\\\nabout that.  as far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  the high\\\\nspeed civil transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\\\\nthis point.\\\\n\\\\nso, this tells me that boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\\\\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \\\\nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\\\\nto persue work on their own.\\\\n\\\\nnow, i do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.

(i ain\\\\\\'t saying that dark skies are included in these \\\\nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nanyway, here are my thoughts on this: \\\\n\\\\n\\\\ni\\\\\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \\\\npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \\\\nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  some of what i \\\\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  many readers may \\\\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\\\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  the space between the stars \\\\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  with full horizons and \\\\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\\\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\\\nany lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\\\nwhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\\\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\\\nin an afterlife.  \\\\n\\\\nthe space age changed all that.  the effect of the first sputniks \\\\nand echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  to see a light \\\\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\\\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\\\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\\\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\\\nbut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\\\n\\\\nyes, i know aircraft are almost always in sight.  i have to live \\\\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\\\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  the \\\\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\\\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\\\ninto shape by the hands of man.  in some places the only life \\\\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\\\n(or rats).  i visited some friends up in the appalacian mountains \\\\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\\\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then i quickly noticed \\\\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into dulles - 60-80 \\\\nmiles to the east.  (their \\\\\\'security light\\\\\\' didn\\\\\\'t help matters \\\\nmuch either.)  but i\\\\\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\\\nhigh air traffic.  so i know the skies are rarely perfect. \\\\n\\\\nbut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\\\\\'t \\\\nfouled in some way.  (i mean they\\\\\\'ve been trying this forever - \\\\nlike, concerning tesla\\\\\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  i don\\\\\\'t watch \\\\ncommercial television, but i can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\\\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\\\nif ya\\\\\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\\\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\\\n\\\\nto be open about this though, i have here my listing of the passage \\\\nof hst in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight friday at \\\\n8:25 p.m. edt it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\\\nlocal meridian from baltimore vicinity.  i\\\\\\'ll be trying to see it \\\\nif i can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  so i suppose i could \\\\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\\\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  be that \\\\nas it may, i think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\\\neven if it can\\\\\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \\\\n\\\\nregards, \\\\nwm. hathaway \\\\nbaltimore md \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n(p.s. added tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome, \\\\njust a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know \\\\nthat other people may not accept it without a complaint.)  \\\\n\\', \"from: prb@access.digex.com (pat)\\\\nsubject: re: comet in temporary orbit around jupiter?\\\\norganization: express access online communications usa\\\\nlines:

that i, hugh kelso, and bob lilly\\\\nhad with an aide of sen. patty murrays.  we were there to discuss ssto, and\\\\ncommercial space.  this is how it went...\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nafter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of ssto,\\\\ni called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local senator (d) patty\\\\nmurray, washington state.  i started asking for an hour, and when i heard\\\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, i quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\\\nlater in that conversation, i learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\\\n\\\\nwe got the standard bozo treatment.  that is, we were called back by an aide,\\\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\\\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\\\n\\\\nwell, i got allocated 1/2 hour with sen. murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\\\nwe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was dcx specific.  \\\\nmost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  there was another\\\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on every topic that\\\\nwe brought up.\\\\n\\\\nbut, with murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\\\naligned (i.e. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\\\nso, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\\\nleo.  solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\\\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\\\nwe hit the tourism angle, and i left a copy of the patric collins tourism\\\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after seeing the smog\\\\nover l.a.  we hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\\\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had potential to lead to \\\\nunderstanding of, and maybe a cure for osteoporosis.  we hit the education \\\\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\\\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\\\n\\\\nwe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\\\nangle.  we hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  jobs provided\\\\nin those sectors.\\\\n\\\\njobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\\\nwe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\\\n\\\\nwe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\\\nto make this even easier to do.  and he asked questions on this point.\\\\n\\\\nwe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\\\\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\\\\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\\\\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\\\\nthe lines of lowering the cost to leo.\\\\n\\\\nin the middle we also gave a little speal about the lunar resource data \\\\npurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was very interested in it.\\\\nhe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\\\\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\\\\nhappen immediatly there.\\\\n\\\\nthe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\\\\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn\\'t know\\\\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\\\\nreally did know the answers.\\\\n\\\\nthen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  he\\\\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\\\\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\\\\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\\\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\\\\n\\\\nall in all we felt like we did a pretty good

space sales \\\\nwill remain flat in 1993, with current data showing only a 2 percent \\\\ngrowth over 1992.  as published in \"us industrial outlook 1993\" \\\\n(which was released in january), revenues from the 1993 us space \\\\nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 m. \\\\n   in contrast to previous years when us commercial space sales had \\\\nshown double digits growth rates, this year\\\\\\'s projected results are \\\\ndriven by the us satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \\\\nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 m in 1992 to 7 \\\\nsatellites worth $ 670 m in 1993.  the us industrial outlook also \\\\nprojects u.s. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \\\\nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \\\\n$450 m, future sales will be \"adversely affected by the downward \\\\nrevision in department of defense launch plans.\"                           \\\\n   offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \\\\nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \\\\nincrease to $1,900 m, primarily driven by increased revenues from \\\\nbroadcast and cable tv networks.  similarly, remote sensing products \\\\nand sales are projected to increase to $250 m in 1993 (up 15%). \\\\n\\\\n us commercial space revenues     1989  1990   1991 1992(r)

4,890\\\\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\\\\n   [commentary: this is the first look at how the us commercial \\\\nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  in general, not a bad \\\\nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \\\\nmanufacturing area.  there, changes of only a few satellites worth \\\\n$100 m or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \\\\nprojection.  if we look forward over several years, this market \\\\nsector should retain strong sales as us firms have been very \\\\nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \\\\nbusiness. \\\\n   furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \\\\nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\\\\nyear.  data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \\\\nsuch items as gps receivers and portable satellite terminals) \\\\nappears to be missing from the january data set.  doc usually \\\\npublishes a listing of  \"space business indicators\" in mid-year, and \\\\nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \\\\nthen.  i expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 m, if \\\\nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \\\\nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \\\\n   looking beyond this year\\\\\\'s data, future markets look quite \\\\npromising.  the doc projects satellite service revenues could top \\\\n$3,000 m by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \\\\nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \\\\nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \\\\nthrough the mid 1990\\\\\\'s.  my numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \\\\nfor near-term market growth, but i agree the trend should be for \\\\nsubstantial growth in us commercial space sales over at least the \\\\nnext 5-10 years.  (my pessimism is due to more conservative \\\\nassumptions on market capture and growth in leo communications and \\\\nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  i don\\\\\\'t believe all of the \\\\ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born leo communications satellite \\\\nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \\\\nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \\\\nas currently projected.) \\\\n   it should also be noted this year\\\\\\'s doc data is the first \\\\nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \\\\nfacilities.  the $60 m shown in the janurary data is primarily for \\\\nthe spacehab module, planned for launch in april on the space \\\\nshuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \\\\nsales from the comet orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \\\\n\\\\n2- delta wins two key launch contracts\\\\n   mcdonnell douglas corporation, which builds and markets the delta \\\\nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  motorola \\\\ninc. announced in mid february that it had selected the delta to \\\\nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite iridium leo \\\\ncommunications constellation, and in mid april, mcdonnell douglas \\\\nwas awarded the usaf medium launch vehicle iii contract. \\\\n   the launch services contract with motorola for the iridium \\\\nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 iridium \\\\nsatellites.  another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \\\\nlaunched by khrunichev enterprise in russian on 3 proton vehicle \\\\nlaunches.  these 45 satellites planned for the delta will be \\\\nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \\\\nadditional satellites in the iridium constellation, such as a \\\\nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on delta.  although \\\\ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \\\\nnegotiation, and not yet final. \\\\n   the usaf mlv contract also went to mdc, bidding a variant of \\\\ntheir delta ii launcher.  this contract is only initially worth $7.5 \\\\nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \\\\nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  these \\\\nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the usaf\\\\\\'s global \\\\npositioning system block iir navigation satellites, plus other \\\\nprograms.  first option for to meet the usaf launch options is \\\\nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the usaf is expected \\\\nto request launches of up to 6 deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \\\\nunder this contract the usaf can also request \"launch on demand\" \\\\nservices from mdc for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \\\\noccur within 40 days of the request. \\\\n    [commentary:  if these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \\\\nprovide an excellent business base for mdc\\\\\\'s delta launch program \\\\nthrough the turn of the century.  combined, these two contracts have \\\\na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 m to mdc, and \\\\nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 m/year.  other contracts \\\\nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for nasa \\\\nmedium elv-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \\\\nmdc as a viable commerical launch company. \\\\n    however, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \\\\ncontracts.  motorola\\\\\\'s iridium leo communications constellation has \\\\nnot yet received a us federal communications commission license for \\\\noperation in the u.s., nor has motorola lined up all the financing \\\\nand financial partners for the iridium venture.  without these \\\\napprovals or financial backing there will be no iridium launches.  \\\\nbut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \\\\n   similarly, the usaf mlv iii program has been the target of \\\\nseveral congressional actions which have slowed the production of \\\\nthe gps block iir satellites and deleted the funding for the mlv iii \\\\nprogram in favor of the usaf nls/\"spacelifter\" program.  at this \\\\ntime, while it appears the mlv iii contract will be executed, future \\\\nfunding for the mlv iii and other usaf commercial launch contracts \\\\nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \\\\nreviews.  some opinions expressed from within the administration and \\\\ncongress propose cancellation of all \"elv upgrade\" programs \\\\n(including the mlv programs) in favor of the proposed \"spacelifter\" \\\\nprogram.  such opinions may have some weight in this year\\\\\\'s budget \\\\ndeliberations, particularly as dod funds will be more difficult to \\\\nfind in the shrinking us defense budget.] \\\\n \\\\n3- commercial remote sensing venture gets doc \"go-ahead\"\\\\n   the first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \\\\nsatellite was approved in early february by the us department of \\\\ncommerce\\\\\\'s office of space commerce.  a license was granted to \\\\nworldview imaging corporation of oakland, california to build and \\\\noperate a pair of leo imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \\\\nimages of the earth. \\\\n   [commentary:  there has been little data released on this venture \\\\nby worldview and the doc, other than the announcement of the \\\\noperating and construction license.  this was reported to be at the \\\\nrequest of worldview.  most industry speculation identifies this new \\\\nventure as a \"star wars\" spinoff, using sdi-type technology to \\\\nprovide digital earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \\\\ndigital gis databases for remote sensing/gis users.  most probable \\\\ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \\\\nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \\\\n   it is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \\\\n1992 land remote sensing policy act.  the act, as passed last \\\\nnovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \\\\nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  prior to \\\\nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \\\\nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \\\\nwould have had to sell at the government-set landsat data prices. \\\\n   there are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \\\\nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \\\\nstages of development.  i think the large landsat and spot satellite \\\\nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \\\\ndata market for the next decade or so.  in contrast to these large, \\\\ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \\\\nsuch as worldview and others can exploit market niches and use \\\\ninnovative technology, and i believe, can find profitability on the \\\\nmargin.  i predict there may be some very interesting ventures \\\\nappearing in the next year or so.] \\\\n                 \\\\n4- investment firm calls gd\\\\\\'s space biz \"still a good investment\" \\\\n   wall street investment house morgan stanley thinks general \\\\ndynamic\\\\\\'s space systems division could still be a moneymaker, \\\\ndespite having failed in the last 3 atlas launches.  in a recent \\\\nanalyst\\\\\\'s report morgan stanley said \"we are more than ever \\\\nconvinced that if the company can return the atlas to its historical \\\\n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\\\\ngenerating unit.\"  based upon discussions with gd\\\\\\'s corporate \\\\nmanagement, morgan stanley projects that if the atlas problems are \\\\ncleared up the unit could see $70 m in earnings per year by 1995 and \\\\n$100 m per year by 2000.  this is based upon gd\\\\\\'s projection of \\\\ncapturing about 10 atlas launches per year on the world market. \\\\n   [commentary:  three failures in a row of their launch system has \\\\nhurt general dynamic\\\\\\'s space systems division.  since gd has \\\\nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \\\\nmany market pundits have been speculating gd\\\\\\'s space business might \\\\nbe next to be sold.  the morgan stanley report indicates gd\\\\\\'s space \\\\nsystems division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \\\\nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  sales are projected \\\\nto be about $560 m in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \\\\nabout $25 m.  if gd can capture their projected share of the space \\\\nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \\\\nof their atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \\\\nfrom those sales.  but until they demonstrate the atlas centaur \\\\nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \\\\nsubstantial losses. \\\\n   in response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \\\\nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \\\\nto do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \\\\nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \\\\nin gd ssd\\\\\\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \\\\nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \\\\nthe atlas centaur, as well as in selling atlas services.  this would \\\\nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \\\\noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \\\\ncustomers to buy their launch services.  optimally, the firm would \\\\nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \\\\nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  candidates for \\\\nthis might be trw, rockwell, lockheed, and martin, and possibly \\\\nmcdonnell douglas and boeing.  but most of those firms have cash \\\\nflow problems (mdc), have had a substantial business contraction \\\\n(boeing and mdc), are involved with other launch firms (lockheed), \\\\nor have taken on substantial debt (martin).  and coming up with the \\\\n$700-1500 m purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \\\\nchange for any company.] \\\\n \\\\n5 - ariane predicts dip in launch demand\\\\n   arianespace, the operator of the ariane launch system, is \\\\nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\\\\\\'s.  in early \\\\nfebruary, arianespace released their annual market survey, which \\\\ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \\\\nnext decade. \\\\n   over short run, arianespace expects to retain their dominant \\\\nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  of 54 \\\\ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, ariane \\\\nholds contracts for 31, general dynamics\\\\\\' atlas vehicle holds 14 \\\\ncontracts, mcdonnell douglas\\\\\\' delta holds 7, and great wall\\\\\\'s long \\\\nmarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \\\\n   three-quarters of future launch contracts for which ariane can \\\\ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \\\\nthe remaining 25% split between weather, earth observation, and \\\\nscientific satellites.  most of the future telecommunications demand \\\\ngrowth is predicted to come from the asia/pacific region. \\\\n   arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \\\\nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \\\\ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \\\\nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \\\\narianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \\\\nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\\\\\\'s average level, to \\\\nabout 3000 kg in geo. \\\\n   demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \\\\nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \\\\ndecade, arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  arianespace \\\\nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \\\\ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \\\\nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \\\\nor near-term transponders. \\\\n   one of the significant possible changes in the market was \\\\nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including russian \\\\nlaunch systems.  but arianespace predicts that in the long term, \\\\ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \\\\noff between launch service quality and price, and that russian and \\\\nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \\\\nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \\\\n   [commentary:  ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \\\\ni reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of csn/sti.  \\\\ncomparing the two surveys, there aren\\\\\\'t outstanding differences in \\\\nthe numbers.   the most notable change is the consideration of new \\\\ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \\\\ntransponders on orbit.\\\\n   i note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\\\\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. while \\\\nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \\\\nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \\\\ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\\\\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \\\\ntransponder demand.  fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \\\\nservice, but only from established point a to established point b. \\\\nto establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \\\\nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \\\\ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \\\\nmillions or billions of dollars.  \\\\n   for broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \\\\nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \\\\nsolution.  and if new services are required into a new region, it is \\\\ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \\\\nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \\\\nnetwork.  this allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \\\\nhas kept demand high.  the replacement market for fiberoptics is \\\\ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \\\\nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \\\\nhandle the increase in traffic. \\\\n   since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \\\\ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  but \\\\nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  current \\\\ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \\\\non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \\\\nlast generation\\\\\\'s satellites.  this has cut back some of the launch \\\\ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \\\\nlaunches over longer intervals. \\\\n   and as last note; arianespace didn\\\\\\'t flag it this year, but it \\\\nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\\\\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  the annual \\\\ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \\\\nper year.  from the supply side, ariane is capable of launching up \\\\nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, delta is capable of \\\\nabout 9-12 per year, atlas is capable of 6-12, long march 4-8, \\\\njapan\\\\\\'s h-vehicle 2-4, russia\\\\\\'s proton capable of 8, and other \\\\nsystems such as zenit and soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \\\\nyear.  that\\\\\\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \\\\n   we can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \\\\nlaunches.]\\\\n\\\\n6- ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort \\\\n   the 9 feb pegasus launch by orbital sciences corporation has \\\\nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \\\\nrules.  a valid abort order from a nasa range safety officer to halt \\\\nthe mission was overridden and the pegasus was launched in violation \\\\nof range safety rules.  \\\\n   in the last few minutes of the pegasus launch countdown, one of \\\\ntwo abort command receivers aboard the pegasus failed.  such a failure \\\\ntypically scrubs a launch,and a nasa range safety officer at \\\\nwallops island, va issued a mission abort order about a minute \\\\nbefore the scheduled pegasus launch.  somehow this command was \\\\noverridden by the osc launch team or the message was lost in the \\\\ncommunications channels, and the pegasus was launched despite the \\\\nvalid abort call. \\\\n   fortunately, the pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \\\\ncommand receiver was not needed.  but this incident did spark an \\\\ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \\\\nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \\\\n   leading the investigation is the national transportation safety \\\\nboard (ntsb) with support from nasa, osc, and the air force.  this \\\\ninvestigation marks the first time ntsb has taken the lead on an \\\\nincident involving a space launch.  according to the ntsb, their \\\\ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \\\\nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \\\\nin the launch. \\\\n  [commentary: this is the first time that the ntsb has led an \\\\ninvestigation into a space launch.  their leadership was requested \\\\nby the department of commerce\\\\\\'s office of commercial space \\\\ntransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \\\\n   at the time of writing this column, some of the initial \\\\ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \\\\nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  apparently, 3 or four \\\\ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. after \\\\nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the nasa test \\\\ndirector and range controller in the mission control room at wallops \\\\nisland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \\\\naccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \\\\nsomehow, the osc test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \\\\nnasa communicator on the net relayed that order to the b-52 carrying \\\\nthe pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  differing \\\\nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \\\\nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \\\\ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \\\\nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \\\\nlaunch.  \\\\n   as we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \\\\nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \\\\nthis case is interesting because it is the first time the ntsb has \\\\nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \\\\ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \\\\n   i think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \\\\nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \\\\nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \\\\nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \\\\n\\\\n7- another pegasus competitor is announced\\\\n   tsniimach enterprise in russia announced it is marketing a new \\\\nsmall space launch system, based upon converted icbm components.  \\\\ntwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \"aerokosmos\" \\\\nwinged vehicle launched like the osc pegasus, and the \"severkosmos\", \\\\nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  the aerokosmos is \\\\nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \\\\nan 800 km circular orbit, and the severkosmos to be capable of 430 \\\\nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  also proposed to be used \\\\nwith these launch systems is a leo data relay system called \\\\n\\\\\\'sineva\\\\\\'.  tsniimach enterprise is described as a ex-military \\\\nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \\\\nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \\\\nburan shuttle system,  they are located near the npo energia \\\\nfacility in kaliningrad, outside of moscow. \\\\n   [commentary: there\\\\\\'s very little released information on this new \\\\nventure.  my suspicion is it is another russian enterprise looking \\\\nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \\\\nknowledge of ex-soviet launch systems.  it adds to the list of numerous \\\\ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-soviet union. \\\\n   this one\\\\\\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \\\\nof ex-soviet icbms, but i can\\\\\\'t identify any key customers being \\\\ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\\\\n\\\\n8- georgia launch site dropped from planning\\\\n   in late january, georgia tech research institute released the \\\\nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \\\\nrocket launching site in camden county, georgia at the old kingsland \\\\nmissile test launching site on the atlantic coast.  the preliminary \\\\nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \\\\nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \\\\nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \\\\nconsiderations.  however, the report did say the site might be ideal \\\\nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \\\\n   [commentary:  this should put the nails in the coffin of the \\\\nkingsland commercial launch site.  while other sites are still \\\\nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, kingsland \\\\nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \\\\nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \\\\nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \\\\n   this might point out some key discriminators in judging the \\\\nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  these include:\\\\n  - is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \\\\nsufficient to recover setup costs?\\\\n  - is there a market advantage of using the site?\\\\n  - can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\\\\n  - can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \\\\ninvestment?  \\\\n   other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \\\\nwoomera, poker flat, cape york, white sands, alabama off-shore \\\\nplatform, hawaii, and vandenberg have to also be judged against \\\\nthese criteria.  in my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \\\\non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\\\\n\\\\n9- spain\\\\\\'s capricornia launcher still proceeding\\\\n   in one of his last official acts, former president bush \\\\nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \\\\nventures between us and other firms.  one of these was a proposed \\\\nuse of us technology by spain to build a small booster.  with that \\\\nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage capricornia launch \\\\nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \\\\nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  the capricornia is described as \\\\na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 kg into \\\\nleo.  several launch sites are being examined for the system, \\\\nincluding 2 on the iberian peninsula and 1 on the canary islands.  \\\\noriginated by inta in spain, the project reports it has $ 30 m in \\\\ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from argentina\\\\\\'s condor \\\\nlaunch vehicle as well as from the us. \\\\n   [commentary:  several firms have identified a market opportunity \\\\nin providing a small launcher for the european market.  small \\\\npayloads from european firms or organizations currently use either \\\\nariane piggyback launches or the us/italian scout launcher.  \\\\nhowever, ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the scout \\\\nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \\\\nitalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \\\\nsystem).  \\\\n   this has left an apparent niche for a new european small launch \\\\nsystem.  surprisingly enough, esa has not supported development of \\\\nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  studies \\\\nhave been performed by british aerospace, aerospatiale, deutsche \\\\naerospace, and italian organizations, but with the exception of the \\\\nswedish/pacastro system (reported below), i have not been able to \\\\nfind any other european development work with even a rumor of \\\\nfunding for hardware. \\\\n   also of interest is the linking of the capricornia to the \\\\nargentinian condor launcher.  there have been some interesting \\\\nrumors surfacing out of argentina over the past year about a space \\\\nlauncher/irbm program funded under the military junta which ruled \\\\nthe country in the 1970\\\\\\'s and early 1980\\\\\\'s. \\\\n   what is known is in feb 1992, the argentinian air force formally \\\\ntransferred control of the condor 2 missile program to the new \\\\ncivilian argentinian national space agency (comison nacional de \\\\natividades espaciales - cnae).  the condor 2 program was described \\\\nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller condor 1 rocket \\\\nprogram in collaboration with egypt and with support of german \\\\nfirms.  the condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by iraq \\\\nin the mid-1980\\\\\\'s.  fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \\\\ntested, but argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \\\\nlagged that of the propulsion system. \\\\n   it should be noted cnae is planning to launch its first \\\\nscientific satellite in late 1994.  the us$ 9 m, 181 kg, sac-b \\\\nsatellite will study the earth\\\\\\'s upper atmosphere and includes \\\\ncooperative experiments from italy and the us. no launch vehicle has \\\\nyet been selected, but osc\\\\\\'s pegasus and the russian burlak air \\\\nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \\\\ncontract.] \\\\n\\\\n10- pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish space corp\\\\n   pacastro, a small launch firm in herndon, virginia announced in \\\\nlate february it had received a $6 m launch reservation contract \\\\nfrom the swedish space corp to launch a satellite on pacastro\\\\\\'s pa-2 \\\\nlaunch vehicle.   this will be performed as part of the polar \\\\nsatellite service (pss), a joint norwegian space center/ swedish \\\\nspace corp. program to upgrade the andoya rocket range in norway and \\\\noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  according \\\\nto pacastro, pss is also performing an $8 m upgrade of the andoya \\\\nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\\\\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \\\\nthe pacastro pa-2.  pacastro has been chosen as \"the main \\\\nalternative rocket supplier\" for the small satellite launch service \\\\nto be offered by pss from andoya.  the date of the launch of the \\\\nswedish satellite was not specified. \\\\n   [commentary:  pacastro has been trying to line up customers and \\\\nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  the pa-2 is a \\\\nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by rp-1 and liquid oxygen.  from \\\\npacastro\\\\\\'s literature, the engines designed for the pa-series \\\\nrockets are built of \"off the shelf\" components based upon the lunar \\\\nmodule descent engines built by trw, and are capable of putting a \\\\n225 kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \\\\n   pacastro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \\\\nfirst three pa-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \\\\n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  my records show pacastro hired \\\\ntrw to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \\\\nengineering to be done by aeroastro, a small satellite builder \\\\nclosely associated with pacastro (headquartered in the same \\\\nbuilding).  the swedish space corporation would supply engineering, \\\\nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \\\\nsumitomo corp. of tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \\\\nboard of directors.  \\\\n   pacastro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \\\\n$550 k  (some sources place this of high as $1 m), but has been \\\\nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 m needed to \\\\ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \\\\n   the launch reservation from ssc can possibly be used to help \\\\nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \\\\nmuch more than the single $6 m sale to put their venture into real \\\\nhardware.] \\\\n\\\\n11- china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported\\\\n    in early march, it was reported a joint satellite communications \\\\nventure between a taiwanese and mainland chinese was in the works.  \\\\nas reported in the taipei press, china development corp. (cdc), \\\\nheadquartered in taiwam and with links to the ruling nationalist \\\\nparty, is planning to set up a joint venture in hong kong with china \\\\ngreat wall industry corp. with the objective of launching a regional \\\\ncommunications satellite. cdc would cover about 10% of the satellite \\\\nsystem cost (us $10 m) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \\\\nsatellite\\\\\\'s communications channels.  \\\\n   [commentary:  this announcement came close on the heels of the \\\\nrelease of taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \\\\njanuary).   in those plans, the national space program office of \\\\ntaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with rocsat-1, a 400 kg \\\\nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  two additional \\\\nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   trw has \\\\nbeen helping taiwan plan this program, budgeted at t$13.6 b (us $530 \\\\nm) through 2006.  \\\\n   i haven\\\\\\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \\\\nventure and those of the nspot, but there might be a connection.  \\\\nwhile taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \\\\ncurrent taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \\\\nseparate sastellite ventures. \\\\n   the reported name for the tiawanese/chinese system is \"asiasat-\\\\n2\", but i don\\\\\\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \\\\nhong kong-based \"asiasat\" program involving chinese, hong kong, and \\\\nother asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \\\\nmodel.  there are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \\\\nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \\\\ntaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \\\\nsatellite ventures.  but there are internal political issues between \\\\ntaiwanese and chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \\\\nthrough a  hong kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \\\\nproceed. \\\\n   in any case, the east asian satellite market is lighting up with \\\\nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  this \\\\nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \\\\n\\\\n12- south korea announces national move into space technologies\\\\n   south korea\\\\\\'s trade, industry and resources ministry recently \\\\nannounced plans to invest us$22 b in research and development and \\\\nanother us$17 b into manufacturing and research facilities for \\\\nadvanced aerospace technologies.  space technologies have been \\\\nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \\\\nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \\\\n1997.  the objective of this investment is to raise south korea\\\\\\'s \\\\naerospace technology to the level of the world\\\\\\'s top 10 countries by \\\\n2000.                                 \\\\n   [commentary: south korea has been quietly working to develop its \\\\nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \\\\nactivities. i\\\\\\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \\\\ncoming into the commercial space market. \\\\n   as part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \\\\nsatellites for korea telecom will be launched in april and oct 1995 \\\\non delta. designated koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \\\\ntelevision and telephone service throughout the korean peninsula, \\\\nsouthwestern japan and portions of china bordering north korea. \\\\n   south korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \\\\nariane in aug 1992, called uribyol-1 (our star) and costing about us \\\\n$8.8 m.  uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in october of \\\\nthis year, again on ariane, and will be entirely \"made in korea.\"  \\\\nuribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\\\\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \\\\n   this satellite may be the precursor to a series of small earth \\\\nobservation satellites,  the keos (korean earth observation system) \\\\nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the south korean \\\\ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \\\\noptical and microwave sensors.\\\\n   south korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \\\\nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \\\\nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  supposedly a \\\\ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \\\\nfunded at us $ 500 m between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \\\\nexpected pullout of u.s. intelligence-gathering systems from the \\\\nkorean peninsula.       \\\\n   in conjunction with all of these reported efforts, south korean \\\\nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \\\\naerospace technology contracts (for example, mcdonnell douglas is \\\\noffsetting production of some delta parts to south korean firms as \\\\npart of the koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \\\\nconsumer space items (among other products, south korea exports \\\\nsatellite receiver television setups to japan, and samsung has \\\\nannounced teaming for production of osc\\\\\\'s orbcomm user terminals.).  \\\\n   this looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \\\\nconsidering that east asia is currently the fastest growing sector \\\\nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \\\\nsouth korean push into space technologies may change the composition \\\\nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \\\\n\\\\n13- space technology indexes through march\\\\n   as announced in the last csn/sti, each issue will give the \\\\nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \\\\ninvestments.  the table below summarizes results to the end of \\\\nmarch.  the space technology index did quite a bit better than the \\\\nmarket as a whole, as represented by the s&p 500 index.  since 90+% \\\\nof the values included in the index are us firms, this represents a \\\\ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  the \\\\nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \\\\nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \\\\ntrend. the commercial space technology index has also done quite \\\\nwell, but the pure play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \\\\nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \\\\nresults in all of 1993.  we\\\\\\'ll keep an eye on these ....\\\\n\\\\n

rather\\\\nthrough a \\\\\\'brute force and ignorance\\\\\\' attack on the problem during the\\\\nchallenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and\\\\ndid the whole process by

eastern horizont near\\\\n    mikkeli. the head of the pillar was circular. the lower part\\\\n    was a little winding. it was like a monster they told. they\\\\n    were little frightened. soon the yellowish pillar became\\\\n    enlarged. a bright spot like the sun was appeared in the middle\\\\n    of the phenomenon. at last the light landed behind the nearby\\\\n    forest. now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were\\\\n    visible till morning sunrise.\\\\n\\\\n    the same phenomenon was observed also by jaakko kokkonen in\\\\n    lappeenranta. at 00.26 ut he saw a luminous yellowish trail in\\\\n    the low northeastern horizont. the altitude of the trail was\\\\n    only about 3-4 degrees. soon the trail began to grow taller.\\\\n    a loop was appeared in the head of the trail. it was like a\\\\n    spoon. this lasted only 10 seconds. now the altitude was about\\\\n    five degress above horizont. he noted a bright spot at the\\\\n    upper stage of loop. the spot was at magnitude -2. the loop\\\\n    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of\\\\n    the loop. a cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright\\\\n    spot. after a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails\\\\n    were only visible in the low horizont. luminous trails were still\\\\n    visible at 01.45 ut in the morning sky.\\\\n\\\\n    the phenomenon was caused by a russian rocket. i don\\'t know if\\\\n    there were satellite launches in plesetsk cosmodrome near\\\\n    arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. since 1969\\\\n    we

trouble.  for\\\\nproviding me this forum i would sincerely like to thank the u.s.\\\\nspace foundation.  my topic today is the single stage rocket\\\\ntechnology rocket or ssrt.  by i intend to speak of more.  how to\\\\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  ssrt is to my mind --\\\\nand i hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\\\\nour generation in space -- faster, cheaper, and better.\\\\n\\\\n     faster, cheaper, better and ssrt represent the passing of a\\\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  it is a new\\\\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\\\\nfrom past masters.\\\\n\\\\n     when we rolled out the ssrt baby two weeks ago, so called\\\\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\\\\nsense.  for example, dr. eberhart rachtin - former president of\\\\nthe aerospace corp., said of ssrt in the l.a. times that it,\\\\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \\\\nwell dr. rachtin -- you\\\\\\'ve made us mad!  what are these\\\\nprinciples that ssrt defies?\\\\n\\\\n     well i\\\\\\'ll tell you.  it violates the principle that you need\\\\na giant program office to build space hardware.  it violates the\\\\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  and it\\\\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\\\\nless than many billions of dollars.\\\\n\\\\n     it took some of the last generation\\\\\\'s experts to teach us\\\\nsome new/old lessons.  werhner von braun\\\\\\'s first rocket was not a\\\\nsaturn v.  general schriever\\\\\\'s icbm\\\\\\'s didn\\\\\\'t take ten years to\\\\ndemonstrate.  and the x-1 airplane didn\\\\\\'t cost $1 billion.\\\\n\\\\n     it took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\\\\\'s to remind\\\\nus of these truths -- max hunter.  max, to remind you, was a\\\\nsenior engineer in the thor irbm program, and old faster, better,\\\\ncheaper success story.  max has been persistent in a vision of a\\\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\\\\\'s. \\\\nbecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - build a\\\\nlittle, test a little.\\\\n\\\\n     next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  we\\\\ndidn\\\\\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\\\\\'d just change\\\\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- the\\\\nals/nls has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\\\\nknown as \"shape shifter\" than \"space lifter.\"  we didn\\\\\\'t spend a\\\\nlot money -- this x-rocket only cost $60 million.  when\\\\\\'s the\\\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  and it didn\\\\\\'t\\\\ntake a lot of time to build -- mcdonnell douglas completed it in\\\\n18 months.  finally, the government program office consisted of\\\\none very over-worked air force major -- motivated in part by the\\\\nthreat that he\\\\\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\\\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\\\n\\\\n     as i described what ssrt is -- and isn\\\\\\'t keep in mind its\\\\nonly a first step.  there are several more steps -- and steps\\\\nthat can easily fail -- before the u.s. can field an ssto.  but\\\\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\\\\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\\\\nbudget.\\\\n\\\\n     let me show a few details on ssrt and how it might evolve:\\\\n(see charts)\\\\n\\\\n     i\\\\\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\\\\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\\\\\'s\\\\nand 1960\\\\\\'s.  they went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\\\ncan\\\\\\'t see straight.  they soft-landed on mars - the least we\\\\ncould do is soft-land on earth!\\\\n\\\\n     but we do have an answer.  we can follow their build a\\\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\\\\nand routine access to space.  i know there are nay sayers among\\\\nyou -- those who say ssrt is a stunt.  it needs more thermal\\\\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\\\\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\\\\n\\\\n     i say to you -- we\\\\\\'ll see you at white sands in june.  you\\\\nbring your view-graphs, and i\\\\\\'ll bring my rocketship.  if we do\\\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

93-64\\\\n\\\\n        dr.  john h.  gibbons, director, office of science and technology\\\\npolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the advisory committee on the\\\\nredesign of the space station on april 3, three budget options as guidance\\\\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\\\\nstation.\\\\n\\\\n        a low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\\\\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  each\\\\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\\\\noperations, utilization, shuttle integration, facilities, research\\\\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\\\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\\\\n\\\\n        over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the nasa\\\\nbudget for the president\\\\\\'s new technology investment.  as a result,\\\\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\\\\nreductions in the rest of the nasa budget.  for example, a space station\\\\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the nasa\\\\nbudget over the next 5 years.\\\\n\\\\n        gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\\\\nthe advisory committee.  generally, the members-designate focused upon\\\\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  they also\\\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\\\\nstation redesign team is following to develop options for the advisory\\\\ncommittee to consider.\\\\n\\\\n        gibbons also announced that the united states and its\\\\ninternational partners -- the europeans, japanese and canadians -- have\\\\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\\\\nrussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\\\\n\\\\n        to that end, the russians will be asked to participate in the\\\\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\\\\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of mir\\\\nand the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems.\\\\nthe u.s. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\\\\nthe russian participants in assessing russian systems and technology.  the\\\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\\\\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\\\\ncareful integration of russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\\\\nthat goal.\\\\n\\\\n        gibbons reiterated that, \"president clinton is committed to the\\\\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\\\\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\\\\nrepresents.  however, he also is committed to a space station that is well\\\\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\\\\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\\\\n\\\\n        nasa administrator daniel s.  goldin said the russian\\\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the east-west space science\\\\ncenter at the university of maryland

proton which would boost\\\\npayload to leo from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (geostationary goes from\\\\n2600 kg. (gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. this scheme was competing\\\\nwith the energia-m last year and i haven\\'t heard which won, except now\\\\ni recently read that the central specialized kb was working on the \\\\nsuccessor to the soyuz booster which must be the energia-m. so the early\\\\nresults are energia-m won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in \\\\nrussia. i\\'m sure if salyut kb gets funds from someone they will continue \\\\ntheir development. \\\\n\\\\nthe centaur for the altas is about 3 meters dia. and the proton \\\\nis 4 so that\\'s a good fit for their existing upper stage, the block-d\\\\nwhich sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. i don\\'t know about\\\\nlaunch loads, etc.. but since the centaur survives titan launches which\\\\nare probably worse than the proton (those titan srb\\'s probably shake things\\\\nup pretty good) it seems feasible. except, the centaur is a very fragile\\\\nthing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.\\\\nprotons are assembled and transported horizontially. does anyone know \\\\nhow much stress in the way of a payload a centaur could support while\\\\nbolted to a proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track\\\\nand erected on the pad?  \\\\n\\\\nthey would also need lox and lh facilities added to the proton pads \\\\n(unless the new proton second stage is actually built), and of course\\\\nany centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the\\\\nus at great cost. these systems may viloate us law so there are political\\\\nproblems

51\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ni feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations\\\\nrule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is\\\\nutterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to\\\\nbatse press releases.\\\\nthe idea behind the statement is as follows: \\\\n     \"if you smack two neutron\\\\n      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,\\\\n      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a\\\\n      cosmological distance. but, so the reasoning continues, this energy \\\\n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\\\\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\\\\n      the observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\\\\n      be wrong.\"\\\\nas so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\\\\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. it\\\\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\\\\nburst, but the \\\\\\'fireball\\\\\\' of energy and matter that is created\\\\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. when this slams into the surrounding \\\\nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\\\\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. all\\\\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by martin rees,\\\\npeter meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\\\\nit is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\\\\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). an alternative\\\\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \\\\nso-called \\\\\\'failed supernovae\\\\\\' scenario by stan woosley, in which\\\\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\\\\nhole. if the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\\\\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\\\\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\\\\nblack hole. this beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\\\\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. the rate of such\\\\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\\\\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\\\\nof bursts observed on earth stays the same between the two\\\\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\\\\nin the failed supernova scenario.\\\\n\\\\non another note: i do believe that the distance scale must \\\\nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\\\\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\\\\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\\\\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. theorists\\\\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\\\\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\\\\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\\\\nit *must* be so-and-so.\\\\n\\\\nralph wijers\\\\n\\\\n\\', \\'from: tombaker@world.std.com (tom a baker)\\\\nsubject: re: shuttle launch question\\\\norganization: me, at the world

grew\\\\nup in an age of miracles -- inter-continental ballistic missiles,\\\\nnuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  but these were\\\\nmiracles of our parent\\\\\\'s doing.  for a decade and more the pundits\\\\nhave told us - \"you\\\\\\'ve lost it!\"  the \"me\" generation is only\\\\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\\\\n\\\\n     you and i have even begun to believe the pessimists.  we\\\\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  living\\\\nhistory they are.  we are privileged to hear those who did it tell\\\\nof it.  a few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\\\\ngeneral bernie schriever told of his team\\\\\\'s work - and yes struggle\\\\n- to build this nation\\\\\\'s intercontinental ballistic missile.\\\\n\\\\n     what stories can we tell?  blurry-eyed telescopes?  thousand\\\\ndollar toilet seats?  even our space launch vehicles hearken only\\\\nof that past great time.  they are and seem destined to remain gen.\\\\nschriever\\\\\\'s icbms.  i find it hard to swell with pride that the\\\\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old minuteman and\\\\nposeidon ballistic missiles.\\\\n\\\\n     well - the pessimists are wrong.  the legacy is continuing. \\\\nthis event is proof.  to our technological parents: we\\\\\\'ve listened\\\\nto your stories.  we\\\\\\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \\\\nand we\\\\\\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  let\\\\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\\\\nbehind this history - max hunter.  you are one of the greatest\\\\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  your\\\\ninsight and discipline built the thor icbm - later incorporated\\\\ninto today\\\\\\'s most successful launch vehicle - the delta.\\\\n\\\\n     you told us in the 60\\\\\\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\\\\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  you\\\\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  it was elegantly simple, as are\\\\nall great breakthroughs.  you showed us how to build it.  you\\\\nconvinced us it could be done.  you are working by our side to weld\\\\nits components into place.  most important - you reminded us of a\\\\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\\\\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\\\\naviation in the 1920\\\\\\'s and 30\\\\\\'s - build a little and test a little\\\\nand max, you passed all of this on  to people like pat ladner who\\\\nstarted this program for the sdi.\\\\n\\\\n     douglas aircraft didn\\\\\\'t start with a dc-10.  they didn\\\\\\'t even\\\\nstart with a dc-3.  our grandfathers built a little, tested a\\\\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\\\\nmoved on to the next step.  they didn\\\\\\'t take a decade or more\\\\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  max hunter - you\\\\ndidn\\\\\\'t take ten years to build thor, and by god we\\\\\\'re not going to\\\\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\\\\naerospace transportation is real.\\\\n\\\\n     we ended the cold war in a few short years.  it took the  same\\\\nteam here today but a few years to show through the strategic\\\\ndefense initiative that the cold war must end.  we - you and us -\\\\nlaunched a series of satellites - the delta experiments - in about\\\\na year apiece.  this, more than anything else signaled our\\\\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the soviet\\\\nunion.  those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\\\\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\\\\nrelationship.\\\\n\\\\n     but it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\\\\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\\\\nnext generation.  we will make space access routine and affordable.\\\\n\\\\n     we built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  this\\\\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\\\\nfirst time.  then we can and surely will build in the next three\\\\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  it will allow us to use space\\\\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  and\\\\nyes - we\\\\\\'ll make a little money off it too!\\\\n\\\\n     then - and only then - we\\\\\\'ll spend another three years to\\\\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  the dc-3 of\\\\nspace will be a reality!  we may even be able to use some of the\\\\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \\\\nwhat a wonderful irony if this sdi product and russian efforts to\\\\ncounter sdi merge to power mankind\\\\\\'s next step to the stars!\\\\n\\\\n     to be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\\\\nthe final answer.  robert goddard\\\\\\'s first rockets weren\\\\\\'t saturn\\\\nv\\\\\\'s!  if we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\\\\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\\\\nsystem - we will fail.  max hunter and his colleagues showed the\\\\nway.  three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\\\\nexhausts.  there is no short-cut.  if we expect to reshape the\\\\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  minds on tasks at\\\\nhand!\\\\n\\\\n     this project is real.  the torch of american technological\\\\ngreatness is being passed.  we are americans.  this machine is\\\\namerican.  let\\\\\\'s go fly it!\\\\n\\',

these\\\\nreadouts verified that contingency mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 am\\\\nyesterday, 4/29/93.  preliminary indications are that a sun ephemeris check\\\\nfailure triggered fault

(exactly if you use newcomb\\\\\\'s\\\\nnumbers rather than leverrier\\\\\\'s.)\\\\n\\\\nof course not everybody believes einstein, and that\\\\\\'s fine.  but subsequent\\\\nefforts to find any

(small expendable deployment system), which released an instrumented\\\\npayload that reentered the earth\\\\\\'s atmosphere and burned up over the west\\\\ncoast of mexico.  this time we want to make a payload that can be recovered.\\\\nwe want to build it from \"off the shelf\" technology so as to do this as\\\\nquickly and inexpensively as possible.  we want to be able to track the\\\\npayload after it has deployed its parachute.  an idea we have is to put the\\\\nsame kind of radio beacon on it that is used with sarsats (search and rescue\\\\nsatellites).  it would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in\\\\ntracking.  these beacons are known in the marine industry as epirbs\\\\n(emergency position indicating radio beacon).  they are rugged (they have to\\\\nbe to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  we have several questions:\\\\n\\\\n1.  what is the world authority regulating the use of sarsat beacons.  are\\\\nthere multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian?\\\\n\\\\n2.  what are the regulations regarding the use of sarsat signals.  can they\\\\nbe used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the\\\\nrelevant authorities,

on dc-? ?\\\\n  \\\\n   boeing has been looking at several tsto vehicles and has carried\\\\nout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some\\\\ntime.  a good reference on this might be: \"comparison of propulsion\\\\noptions for advanced earth-to-orbit (eto) applications (iaf-92-\\\\n0639).\" by v.a. weldon and l.e. fink from boeing.   the paper\\\\ndescribes a propane-fueled tsto launch system claimed to achieve\\\\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\\\\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  basically, it\\\\\\'s a high-speed\\\\nairplane launching a hermes-type spaceplane\\\\n   the design (the concept is also called \"beta\") as laid out in the\\\\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\\\\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\\\\nlife support.  system design reliability is .9995.\\\\n   beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\\\\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (hsct) turbofans.  a 108-foot-\\\\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\\\\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\\\\npayload on an expendable second stage.\\\\n   to launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\\\\nnormal hsct and accelerates to mach 3.  at that point the turbofans,\\\\nmodified to burn catalyzed jp-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\\\\nwould take over.  at mach 5.5 the orbiter or the elv would swing\\\\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. both vehicles would land like\\\\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\\\\n   estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\\\\nis about 1.5 m lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded an-225.\\\\nthe orbiter stages weighs about 400,klbs including 335 klbs\\\\nof lox and subcooled propane to power two 250 klbs vacuum thrust\\\\nrocket engines. propellants would be stored at 91 degrees kelvin,\\\\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\\\\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. lox would\\\\nbe stored aft.  weldon and fink claim the key to this design\\\\\\'s\\\\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\\\\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\\\\n     the paper compares tsto design to ssto design.  they conclude\\\\nwhile a ssto has a slightly lower recurring cost, a tsto is easier,\\\\ncheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater\\\\nsafety and mission versatility and doesn\\\\\\'t carry the hard-to-handle\\\\nand bulky hydrogen fuel. the conlcude \"in conjunction with its major\\\\nuse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-\\\\nferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide\\\\nas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical\\\\nconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can\\\\nbe shown to be operationally viable.\"\\\\n  \\\\n>is this really news? does this threaten further work on dc-?\\\\n   weldon and others at boeing have been working on tsto designs for\\\\nsome time.  i expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the hthl\\\\nssto they proposed for the sdio ssto first phase) is being re-\\\\nexamined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of spacelifter.\\\\n   does it threaten dc-???.  possibly -- there is a set of on-going\\\\nstudies trying straighten out the government\\\\\\'s future space\\\\ntransportation strategy.  mdc and boeing (as well as other firms)\\\\nare providing data to a joint study team back in dc.  there are\\\\nvarious factions and options vying for attention -- including\\\\nshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the \"4-2-3\"\\\\narchitecture), spacelifter, elv upgrades, and various advanced\\\\nvehicles (ales, beta, dc-??, nasp, fsts, sstos of several types,\\\\netc.)  nasa/dod/dot are trying to put together a coherent strategy\\\\nfor future us gov\\\\\\'t space transportation systems, and trying to\\\\njuggle near-term launch needs (like for dod and nasa) against\\\\nmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against\\\\nthe investment and risk of going to \"leap frog\" new technologies\\\\nlike sdio/ssto and nasp and beta.\\\\n   it\\\\\\'s a heck of a problem.  the worst part of the problem isn\\\\\\'t\\\\nthat there aren\\\\\\'t promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens\\\\nof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in\\\\nthe near term.  they should have a draft report in mid-june, with a\\\\nfinal report coming by the end of the fiscal year.\\\\n

considered in\\\\ncrystal city.  mr. mark holderman works down the hall from me, and can\\\\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\\\\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\\\\n\\\\nmark proposed this design, which he calls \"geode\" (\"rough on the\\\\noutside, but a gem on the inside\") or the \"et strongback with\\\\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge.\"  as you can see from file\\\\ngeodea.gif, it uses a space shuttle external tank (et) in place of much\\\\nof the truss which is currently part of space station freedom.  the\\\\nwhite track on the outside of the et is used by the station remonte\\\\nmanipulator system (srms) and by the reaction control system (rcs)\\\\npod.  this allows the rcs pod to move along the track so that thrusting\\\\ncan occur near the center of gravity (cg) of the station as the mass\\\\nproperties of the station change during assembly.\\\\n\\\\nthe inline module design allows the shuttle to dock more easily because\\\\nit can approach closer to the station\\\\\\'s cg and at a structurally strong\\\\npart of the station.  in the current ssf design, docking forces are\\\\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\\\\ndocking system.\\\\n\\\\nthe et would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\\\\nlaunch mass.  we\\\\\\'ve always had the ability to put an et into orbit\\\\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\\\\\\'ve never\\\\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\\\\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\\\\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  once on-orbit, we would vent the\\\\nresidual h2.  the et insulation (sofi) either a) erodes on-orbit from\\\\nimpact with atomic oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\\\\nkevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\\\\nthe local space environment.  option b) has the advantage of providing\\\\nfurther micrometeor protection.  the et is incredibly strong (remember,\\\\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\\\\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\\\\n\\\\nthe white module at the end of et contains a set of control moment\\\\ngyros to be used for attitude control, while the rcs will be used\\\\nfor gyro desaturation.  the module also contains a de-orbit system\\\\nwhich can be used at the end of the station\\\\\\'s life to perform a\\\\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\\\\\\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\\\\ndid with skylab).\\\\n\\\\nthe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\\\\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\\\\non humans.  the centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\\\\nfor the whole attitude control system.  the centrifuge is mounted on\\\\none of the modules, opposite the et and the solar panels.\\\\n\\\\nthis design uses most of the existing ssf designs for electrical,\\\\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the ssf work\\\\ndone to date.\\\\n\\\\nmark proposed this design at joe shea\\\\\\'s committee in crystal city,\\\\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  however, the rumors\\\\ni hear say that a design based on a wingless space shuttle orbiter\\\\nseems more likely.\\\\n\\\\nplease note

(its not eternal, there\\\\\\'s more than one way back) \\\\n\\\\n accepting rides to the past:\\\\nonce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \\\\nprince, or a queen, or you can live as a god in ancient greece. go \\\\nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, adam henry. \\\\ni hope you like inspecting your socks. careful though, if he likes \\\\nyour work, but thinks you\\\\\\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \\\\npaths with your old self, and you\\\\\\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \\\\ncourse of history, none the wiser.\\\\n\\\\n  as we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \\\\nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. he can still \\\\nmake changes while he\\\\\\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \\\\nevery \\\\\\'adjustment\\\\\\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \\\\nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \\\\nbut he can\\\\\\'t see the change. the basic nature of man is good. he had \\\\nto apply his hand to achieve his world. as he now tightens his hand \\\\nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \\\\n\\\\n  how about public computer access to the i.r.s. ? its our country, \\\\nour money, and they\\\\\\'re spending it on us, right? imagine this: \\\\nwashington marks the next cost at 8, irs collects 10, gives 5 to \\\\ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. congress borrows 2. the banks \\\\nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? big \\\\ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. what do the \\\\nbanks do with it? hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \\\\nmostly, bury it. why? food production is 2% gnp?, construction 6% ? 14 \\\\nhours to build your auto?  the people are spending all of their time \\\\nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. have we been deceived? if \\\\nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? what if \\\\nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \\\\n\\\\n  in that other reality, i shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" they \\\\nsaid, \"no, its order.\" he defined chaos as that which is he was not \\\\nable to control.\\\\n\\\\n  rain forest: the problem could be that all the water in its canopy \\\\nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \\\\nlanguage. (telepathic; and \\\\\\'vanishing\\\\\\' the closest knowledge of death)\\\\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \\\\npointed up, you can locate it from above) these people are probably \\\\nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. also, they should \\\\nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that i talk about. \\\\nthey can hear him. i think that ham and world band radio old timers \\\\nmight have a story to tell on this. these people would be on a \\\\ndifferent frequency than us as they aren\\\\\\'t eating seeds.\\\\n\\\\n  famine relief: when i make my diet almost all whole wheat, i get a \\\\nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep a lot, and get sick. when i eat \\\\nonly fresh fruit, i get more energy, a hollywood-flat belly, and \\\\nneed a lot less sleep.\\\\n\\\\n  un. peace keeping; there is fighting and killing all over. the \\\\ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its ok to kill \\\\neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\\\\n\\\\n  somalia: what is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \\\\ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \\\\nsuck on. it is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \\\\nthey aren\\\\\\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \\\\n\\\\n  women with children, babes in arms: historical references to women \\\\nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \\\\nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) i think \\\\nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \\\\nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. there are examples \\\\nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\\\\n\\\\n  that guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. he \\\\ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \\\\nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) he\\\\\\'ll \\\\nplay a poker face up until he thinks he\\\\\\'s cornered, and then he\\\\\\'ll \\\\nwhine, beg and grovel. all it means to him is that you\\\\\\'re willing to \\\\nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \\\\nright, and he didn\\\\\\'t over play his hand, and he won\\\\\\'t need to go \\\\nback and try another thread of time. you have ultimate control over \\\\nyour destiny, just don\\\\\\'t live along a path that leads to a reality \\\\nin which you don\\\\\\'t want to be a part of. \\\\n\\\\n  i don\\\\\\'t claim to be the first to think these things, its just \\\\nthat the others could have been \\\\\\'pruned\\\\\\' from our path. maybe these \\\\nthoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n\\', \\'from: pgf@srl03.cacs.usl.edu (phil g. fraering)\\\\nsubject: re: gamma ray bursters how energetic could they be?\\\\norganization: univ. of southwestern louisiana\\\\nlines: 31\\\\n\\\\nprb@access.digex.net (pat) writes:\\\\n\\\\n>in article <1rou8ginn7s4@gap.caltech.edu> palmer@cco.caltech.edu (david m. palmer) writes:\\\\n>|prb@access.digex.com (pat) writes:\\\\n>|\\\\n>|>in article <1993apr26.200406.1@vax1.mankato.msus.edu> belgarath@vax1.mankato.msus.edu writes:\\\\n>|>|energetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.\\\\n>|>|and lastly, for the cosmological model an l=10^53. that\\\\\\'s what you\\\\\\'d call\\\\n>|>|moderately energetic, i\\\\\\'d say.  any suggestions about what could put out that\\\\n>|>|much energy in one second? \\\\n>|>>                                                -jeremy\\\\n>|\\\\n>|>big capacitor :-)   real big  capacitor.\\\\n>|\\\\n>|it\\\\\\'s been suggested.

\\\\nnntp-posting-host: tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov\\\\norganization: nasa lewis research center / cleveland, ohio\\\\nlines: 76\\\\n\\\\nnasa headquarters distributed the following press\\\\nrelease today (4/6). i\\\\\\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\\\\nfolks to chew over. many of the topics recently\\\\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\\\\n\\\\ngibbons outlines space station redesign guidance\\\\n\\\\ndr. john h. gibbons, director, office of science and\\\\ntechnology policy, outlined to the members-designate of\\\\nthe advisory committee on the redesign of the space\\\\nstation on april 3, three budget options as guidance to\\\\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\\\\nthe space station.\\\\n\\\\na low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\\\\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\\\\nconsidered by the committee. each option would cover\\\\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\\\\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, shuttle\\\\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\\\\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\\\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\\\\navailable funds.\\\\n\\\\nover the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\\\\nthe nasa budget for the president\\\\\\'s new technology\\\\ninvestment. as a result, station options above $7\\\\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\\\\nthe rest of the nasa budget.  for example, a space\\\\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\\\\nin offsets from the nasa budget over the next 5 years.\\\\n\\\\ngibbons presented the information at an organizational\\\\nsession of the advisory committee. generally, the\\\\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\\\\nand used the session to get acquainted. they also\\\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\\\\non the process the station redesign team is following\\\\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\\\\nconsider.\\\\n\\\\ngibbons also announced that the united states and its\\\\ninternational partners -- the europeans, japanese, and\\\\ncanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\\\\n\"full consideration\" to use of russian assets in the\\\\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\\\\n\\\\nto that end, the russians will be asked to participate\\\\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\\\\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\\\\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of mir and the\\\\npossible use of mir and other russian capabilities and\\\\nsystems. the u.s. and international partners hope to\\\\nbenefit from the expertise of the russian participants\\\\nin assessing russian systems and technology. the\\\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\\\\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\\\\nresearch and exploration capabilities. careful\\\\nintegration of russian assets could be a key factor in\\\\nachieving that goal.\\\\n\\\\ngibbons reiterated that, \"president clinton is\\\\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\\\\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\\\\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\\\\nhowever, he also is committed to a space station that\\\\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\\\\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\\\\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"\\\\n\\\\nnasa

research involving rockets.\\\\nc) a member or representative of an educational organization involved in\\\\nresearch or other uses of rockets. there are two such organizations: \\\\nthe tripoli rocketry association and the national association of rocketry.\\\\nmembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\\\\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\\\\n\\\\nthe faa will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \\\\norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \\\\nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. the usual stipulations are:\\\\n- only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. depending on the\\\\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet agl. \\\\n- the operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\\\\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\\\\n- flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\\\\n- the faa will provide a notam informing other users of the airspace that\\\\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\\\\n\\\\nmost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\\\\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\\\\nwestern deserts (the black rock desert north of reno is particularly popular\\\\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\\\\n\\\\nthe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\\\\\\'\\\\nuse, to insure safety. depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\\\\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \\\\n\\\\nby the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \"f\" motor are exempt from\\\\nmost federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. see far 101, subpart\\\\nc, for details.\\\\n\\\\nas for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\\\\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. the typical\\\\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\\\\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. many rockets also carry\\\\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\\\\nin the eastern us, where there are more obstructions.\\\\n\\\\ncamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\\\\n\\\\n>and no, i\\\\\\'m not going to even think of buying one.  i\\\\\\'m not that crazy.\\\\n\\\\nwhy not? it\\\\\\'s a lot of fun...check out the traffic on

eder)\\\\nsubject: re: guns for space\\\\nkeywords: sopa gun, space launcer\\\\norganization: boeing ai center, huntsville, al\\\\nlines: 72\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nokay, lets get the record straight on the livermore gas gun.  \\\\nthe project manager is dr. john hunter, and he works for the\\\\nlaser group at livermore.  what, you may ask, does gas guns\\\\nhave to do with lasers? nothing, really, but the gun is physically\\\\nlocated across the road from the free electron laser building,\\\\nand the fel building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\\\\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  so i suspect that the\\\\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\\\\n\\\\ni visited hunter at the beginning of feb. and we toured the gun.\\\\nat the time i was working on gas gun r&d at boeing, where i work,\\\\nbut i am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\\\\n\\\\nthe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\\\\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch id (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\\\\nthe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\\\\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  on the other side of the piston\\\\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\\\\nof atmospheres.\\\\n\\\\nthe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\\\\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\\\\nthe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\\\\nbore.  it is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\\\\nintersect).  this was done so that in the future, the barrel\\\\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\\\\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  the projectile being used\\\\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\\\nand about 50 cm long.\\\\n\\\\nall of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\\\\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\\\\nbarrel.  the barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\\\\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than saran wrap).  the\\\\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\\\\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \\\\n\\\\nthe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\\\\nwater jugs.  in the early testing fragments of the plastic\\\\nprojectile were found.  at the higher speeds in later testing,\\\\nthe projectile vaporizes.\\\\n\\\\nthe testing is into a bunker because the livermore test range is\\\\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\\\\nif fired for maximum range.  the intent is to move the whole gun\\\\nto vandenberg afb after the testing is complete, where they can\\\\nfire into the pacific ocean, and use the tracking radar at vafb\\\\nto follow the projectiles.\\\\n\\\\nthe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\\\\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  so far they have reached 2 km/s,\\\\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\\\\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (i think it\\\\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\\\\ni haven\\'t had a chance to talk to hunter directly on this).\\\\n\\\\nthere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\\\\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at mach 12=\\\\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is mach 8.\\\\n\\\\nthis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\\\\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\\\\nsized payloads into space.  this would require on the order of\\\\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\\\\nuseful payload to orbit.\\\\n\\\\ndani eder\\\\n\\\\n--

on april 19, cruise science memory readouts (mros) were performed for the\\\\nextreme ultraviolet spectrometer (euv), dust detector (dds), and magnetometer\\\\n(mag) instruments.  preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\\\nproperly.\\\\n\\\\n2.  on april 19, a command detector unit signal-to-noise ratio (cdusnr) test\\\\nand a radio frequency subsystem automatic gain control (rfsagc) test were\\\\nperformed using the lga-1 (low gain antenna #1) over dss-63 (madrid 70 meter\\\\nantenna) and dss-61 (madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  data analysis\\\\nis in process.  these tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\\\\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\\\\n\\\\n3.  on april 19, a no-op command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\\\n\\\\n4.  on april 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/dsn (deep space network)\\\\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over dss-14 (goldstone\\\\n70 meter antenna).  the spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\\\\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\\\\n\\\\n5.  the ac bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\\\\n(greater than 25 dn) throughout this period but the dc bus imbalance\\\\nmeasurement has.  the ac measurement reads 20 dn (4.5 volts).  the dc\\\\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 dn (4.6 volts) to 138 dn (16.2 volts) and\\\\ncurrently reads 138 dn (16.2 volts).  these measurements are consistent with\\\\nthe model developed by the ac/dc special anomaly team.\\\\n\\\\n6.  the spacecraft status as of april 22, 1993, is as follows:\\\\n\\\\n       a)  system power margin -  68 watts\\\\n       b)  spin configuration - dual-spin\\\\n       c)  spin rate/sensor - 3.15rpm/star scanner\\\\n       d)  spacecraft attitude is approximately 21 degrees\\\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)\\\\n       e)  downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/lga-1\\\\n       f)  general thermal control - all temperatures within\\\\n           acceptable range\\\\n       g)  rpm tank pressures - all within acceptable range\\\\n       h)  orbiter science- instruments powered on are the pws,\\\\n           euv, uvs, epd, mag, hic, and dds\\\\n       i)  probe/rrh - powered off, temperatures within\\\\n           acceptable range\\\\n       j)  cmd loss timer setting - 264 hours\\\\n           time to initiation - 184 hours\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ntrajectory\\\\n\\\\n     as of noon thursday, april 22, 1993, the galileo spacecraft trajectory\\\\nstatus was as follows:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tdistance from earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 au)\\\\n\\\\tdistance from sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 au)\\\\n\\\\theliocentric speed          91,200 km per hour\\\\n\\\\tdistance from jupiter       532,735,900 km\\\\n\\\\tround trip light time       18 minutes, 58 seconds\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nspecial topic\\\\n\\\\n1.  as of april 22, 1993, a total of 70185 real-time commands have been\\\\ntransmitted to galileo since launch.  of these, 65077  were initiated in the\\\\nsequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.\\\\nin the past week, one real time command was transmitted: one was initiated in\\\\nthe sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command\\\\nprocess. the only command activity was a command to reset the command loss\\\\ntimer.\\\\n     ___    _____     ___\\\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\\\\\  /_

dc\\\\n>\\\\n>>now, space marketing\\\\n>>is working with university of colorado and livermore engineers on\\\\n>>a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth\\\\n>>orbit.\\\\n>\\\\n>this sounds like something lowell wood would think of.  does anyone\\\\n>know if he\\\\\\'s involved?\\\\n\\\\nno.  the idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible\\\\nnear-term commercial space activities.  one of the folks involved in those\\\\ndiscussions, a\\\\nspacecraft engineer named preston carter, passed the suggestion on to \\\\nsome entreprenurial types, and mike lawson is apparently going ahead with\\\\nit.  preston is now at llnl, and is working with space marketing on \\\\nthe sensors that might be carried.\\\\n>\\\\n>>nasa would provide contractual launch services. however,\\\\n>>since nasa bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates\\\\n>>(wn 26 mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. \\\\n\\\\nactually, that sounds unlikely.  i don\\\\\\'t know what the launch vehicle\\\\nwould be, but i would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --\\\\ncertainly not on the shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to nasa\\\\nfor, e.g.,  launch support would probably \\\\ncover nasa\\\\\\'s incremental costs pretty well.\\\\n\\\\n>>this\\\\n>>may look like environmental vandalism, but mike lawson, ceo of\\\\n>>space marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the\\\\n>>project is to help the environment! the platform will carry ozone\\\\n>>monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs.\\\\n>\\\\n>this may be the purpose for the university of colorado people.  my\\\\n>guess is that the purpose for the livermore people is to learn how to\\\\n>build large, inflatable space structures.\\\\n\\\\nno, as noted, llnl is involved in lightweight sensor design, per \\\\nclementine and related programs.  i\\\\\\'m sure folks around here would like to \\\\nsee a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all, \\\\nthe u.s. did the echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure\\\\nwould not be much closer to an inflatable space station than echo was\\\\n(or a parade balloon, for that matter).\\\\n>\\\\n>>..........\\\\n>>what do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize\\\\n>>the night sky? it is not even april 1 anymore.\\\\n\\\\nwhile i happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because i\\\\\\'ve got\\\\na background in astronomy, it\\\\\\'s hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived\\\\nintrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting\\\\nonly a small subset of astronomers.  on the other hand, it would certainly\\\\ndraw attention to space.   \\\\n>\\\\n>if this is true, i think it\\\\\\'s a great idea.\\\\n>\\\\n>learning how to build structures in space in an essential\\\\n>step towards space development...\\\\n\\\\nwhich, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.\\\\n\\\\n>if such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates\\\\n>creative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so\\\\n>much the better.\\\\n>\\\\n>>is nasa really supporting this junk?\\\\n\\\\nas far as i know, it\\\\\\'s a purely commercial venture.\\\\n>\\\\n>and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn\\\\n>news blip?  how serious is this project?  is this just in the \"wild\\\\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\\\\n\\\\ni gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers.\\\\ncommercial projects, however, generally don\\\\\\'t get \"funding\" -- they\\\\nget \"customers\" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.\\\\n>\\\\n>>are protesting groups being organized in the states?\\\\n>\\\\n>not yet.  though, if this project goes through, i suppose the return\\\\n>of jeremy rifkin is

rumors\\\\n>i hear say that a design based on a wingless space shuttle orbiter\\\\n>seems more likely.\\\\n\\\\nyo ken, let\\\\\\'s keep on-top of things! both the \"external tank\" and\\\\n\"wingless orbiter\" options have been deleted from the ssf redesign\\\\noptions list. today\\\\\\'s (4/23) edition of the new york times reports\\\\nthat o\\\\\\'connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\\\n\\\\ncurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\\\ntoday\\\\\\'s times).\\\\n\\\\noption \"a\" - low cost modular approach\\\\nthis option is being studied by a team from msfc. {as an aside,\\\\nthere are ssf redesign teams at msfc, jsc, and larc supporting\\\\nthe srt (station redesign team) in crystal city. both lerc and\\\\nreston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\\\nteams with their redesign activities.} key features of this\\\\noption are:\\\\n  -  uses \"bus-1\", a modular bus developed by lockheed that\\\\\\'s\\\\n     qualified for sts and elv\\\\\\'s. the bus provides propulsion, gn&c\\\\n     communications, & data management. lockheed developed this\\\\n     for the air force.\\\\n  -  a \"power station capability\" is obtained in 3 shuttle flights.\\\\n     ssf solar arrays are used to provide 20 kw of power. the vehicle\\\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\\\n     shuttle/spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\\\n  -  human tended capability (as opposed to the old ssf sexist term\\\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\\\n     us common module. this is a modified version of the existing\\\\n     ssf lab module (docking ports are added for the international\\\\n     partners\\\\\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on ssf). the\\\\n     shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\\\n     the orbiter would provide crew habitability & eva capability.\\\\n  -  international human tended. add the nasda & esa modules, and\\\\n     add another 20 kw of power\\\\n  -  permanent human presence capability. add a 3rd power module,\\\\n     the u.s. habitation module, and an acrv (assured crew return\\\\n     vehicle).\\\\n\\\\noption \"b\" - space station freedom derived\\\\nthe option \"b\" team is based at larc, and is lead by mike griffin.\\\\nthis option looks alot like the existing ssf design, which we\\\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\\\n\\\\nthis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\\\nuse on all ssf assembly flights (so does option \"a\"). also, the \\\\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\\\nfor both options \"a\" and \"b\".\\\\n\\\\nthe build-up occurs in six phases:\\\\n  -  initial research capability reached after 3 flights. power\\\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the orbiter/spacelab, when\\\\n     it visits.\\\\n  -  man-tended capability (griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. the u.s. lab is\\\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kw of power.\\\\n  -  permanent human presence capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\\\n     keeping one orbiter on-orbit to use as an acrv (so sometimes\\\\n     there would be two orbiters on-orbit - the acrv, and the\\\\n     second one that comes up for logistics & re-supply).\\\\n  -  a \"two fault tolerance capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\\\n  -  after 20 flights, the internationals are on-board. more power,\\\\n     the habitation module, and an acrv are added to finish the\\\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\\\n\\\\nmost of the systems currently on ssf are used as-is in this option, \\\\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\\\nchanges.\\\\n\\\\noption c - single core launch station.\\\\nthis is the jsc lead option. basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\\\ncylinder that\\\\\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 space shuttle main engines on\\\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\\\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\\\nmotors, and launch the can. some key features are:\\\\n  - complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\\\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\\\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\\\n  - 10 kw of housekeeping power\\\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\\\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\\\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\\\n\\', \\'from:

0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\\\\nfair efficiency.  however, at temperatures below 100 k, 90% of the\\\\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\\\\nefficiency is poor.  (a small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\\\\nwavelengths.)  thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\\\\nthe energy they have absorbed.\\\\n\\\\nmoreover, the iras observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\\\\nmicrons.  grains colder than 30 k will radiate primarily at longer\\\\nwavelengths, and iras would be relatively insensitive to them.  in\\\\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 k will be almost undetectable\\\\nby any conceivable observation.\\\\n\\\\nworse still, iras color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\\\\npopulation of \"small\" grains.  these grains have only perhaps 50\\\\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\\\\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 k.  of course they cool\\\\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\\\\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred k.  even a small\\\\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\\\\n\"average\" temperature.\\\\n\\\\na model for local infrared emission consistent with cobe data has\\\\nthree components.  these represent scattered radiation from zodiacal\\\\ndust (color temperature 5500 k), thermal emission from zodiacal dust\\\\n(tc = 280 k), and thermal emission from galactic dust (tc=25 k).  at\\\\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\\\\nrespectively 1.9e-13, 4e-8, and 2e-5.  the first two are roughly\\\\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\\\\n\\\\nto find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\\\\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\\\\ntake the fourth root.  in the table below, starlight comes from\\\\nallen\\\\\\'s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent\\\\nto 460 zero mag stars with b-v color of 0.75.  no doubt careful work\\\\ncould do much better.

euclidean.\" \\\\n    \\\\n               from these two postulates, larson developed a complete \\\\n          theoretical universe, using various combinations of \\\\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\\\n          rotational motions, the concepts of in-ward and out-ward \\\\n          scalar motions, and speeds in relation to the speed of light \\\\n          (which larson called \"unit velocity\" and \"the natural \\\\n          datum\"). \\\\n      \\\\n               at each step in the development, larson was able to \\\\n          match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the \\\\n          real physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\\\n          [incomplete atoms], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\\\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\\\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, etc.), even objects not yet \\\\n          discovered then (such as exploding galaxies, and gamma-ray \\\\n          bursts). \\\\n          \\\\n               and applying his theory to his new model of the atom, \\\\n          larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter-\\\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\\\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\\\n          matter. \\\\n\\\\n               all of this is described in good detail, with-out fancy \\\\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          books of dewey b. larson\\\\n          \\\\n

\"reciprocity\". \\\\n\\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n          physicist dewey b. larson\\\\\\'s background\\\\n    \\\\n               physicist dewey b. larson was a retired engineer \\\\n          (chemical or electrical).  he was about 91 years old when he \\\\n          died in may 1989.  he had a bachelor of science degree in \\\\n          engineering science from oregon state university.  he \\\\n          developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the \\\\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute \\\\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\\\n    \\\\n               larson\\\\\\'s lack of a fancy \"ph.d.\" degree might be one \\\\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\\\n          not a valid reason.  sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\\\n          to clearly see the forest through the trees.  at the same \\\\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox \\\\n          physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer, \\\\n          well enough to point out all their contradictions, ad hoc \\\\n          assumptions, principles of impotence, in-consistencies, etc.. \\\\n     \\\\n               larson did not have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\\\n          test his theory.  and it was not necessary for him to do so.  \\\\n          he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other \\\\n          researchers\\\\\\' experimental and observational data.  and in \\\\n          many cases, his explanation fit better. \\\\n    \\\\n               a self-consistent theory is much more than the orthodox \\\\n          physicists and astronomers have!  they claim to be looking \\\\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\\\n          ignoring one for over 30 years now! \\\\n    \\\\n               \"modern physics\" does not explain the physical universe \\\\n          so well.  some parts of some of larson\\\\\\'s books are full of \\\\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\\\n          agree.  and remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\\\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., also once seemed \\\\n          to explain it well, but were later proved conceptually wrong. \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n               prof. frank h. meyer, professor emeritus of uw-superior, \\\\n          was/is a strong proponent of larson\\\\\\'s theory, and was (or \\\\n          still is) president of larson\\\\\\'s organization, \"the \\\\n          international society of unified science\", and editor of \\\\n          their quarterly journal \"reciprocity\".  he moved to \\\\n          minneapolis after retiring. \\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          \"super collider\" boondoggle!\\\\n          \\\\n               i am against contruction of the \"superconducting super \\\\n          collider\", in texas or anywhere else.  it would be a gross \\\\n          waste of money, and contribute almost nothing of \"scientific\" \\\\n          value. \\\\n    \\\\n               most physicists don\\\\\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\\\n          comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist \\\\n          dewey b. larson, as described in his books, the strange goofy \\\\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", alleged \"quarks\", etc.) \\\\n          which they are finding in existing colliders (fermi lab, \\\\n          cern, etc.) are really just atoms of anti-matter, which are \\\\n          created by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\\\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\\\n          with their environment. \\\\n    \\\\n               a larger and more expensive collider will only create a \\\\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\\\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be even more \\\\n          confused than they are now! \\\\n    \\\\n               are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\\\n          billion cost?!!  don\\\\\\'t we have much more important uses for \\\\n          this wasted money?! \\\\n    \\\\n     \\\\n               another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\\\n          location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\\\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\\\n          cables.  how much poisoning of the ground and ground water \\\\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\\\n          the \"supercollider\"?! \\\\n    \\\\n          \\\\n               naming the \"super collider\" after ronald reagon, as \\\\n          proposed, is totally absurd!  if it is built, it should be \\\\n          named after a leading particle physicist. \\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          larsonian anti-matter\\\\n          \\\\n               in larson\\\\\\'s comprehensive general unified theory of the \\\\n          physical universe, anti-matter is not a simple case of \\\\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  it has more \\\\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\\\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\\\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\\\n          which larson calls \"unit velocity\" and the \"natural datum\". \\\\n     \\\\n               in larson\\\\\\'s theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\\\n          matter, not anti-matter.  when a positron and electron meet, \\\\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\\\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\\\n          other. \\\\n      \\\\n               in larson\\\\\\'s theory, the anti-matter half of the physical \\\\n          universe has three dimensions of time, and only one dimension \\\\n          of space, and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our \\\\n          material half. \\\\n       \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          larsonian relativity\\\\n          \\\\n               the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury \\\\n          has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the \\\\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\\\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\\\n          perturbations from the other planets (venus, earth, jupiter, \\\\n          etc.).  the remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\\\n          help \"prove\" einstein\\\\\\'s \"general theory of relativity\". \\\\n    \\\\n               but the late physicist dewey b. larson achieved results \\\\n          closer to the 43 seconds than \"general relativity\" can, by \\\\n          instead using \"special relativity\".  in one or more of his \\\\n          books, he applied the lorentz transformation on the high \\\\n          orbital speed of mercury. \\\\n    \\\\n               larson totally rejected \"general relativity\" as another \\\\n          mathematical fantasy.  he also rejected most of \"special \\\\n          relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\\\n          the speed of light, and the use of the lorentz transform on \\\\n          doppler shifts, (those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\\\n          1.000 really are moving faster than the speed of light, \\\\n          although most of that motion is away from us in time.). \\\\n     \\\\n               in larson\\\\\\'s comprehensive general unified theory of the \\\\n          physical universe, there are three dimensions of time instead \\\\n          of only one.  but two of those dimensions can not be measured \\\\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  the one \\\\n          dimension that we can measure is the clock time.  at low \\\\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\\\n          negligible; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\\\n          the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor. \\\\n          [larson often used the term \"coordinate time\" when writing \\\\n          about this.] \\\\n    \\\\n     \\\\n               in regard to \"mass increases\", it has been proven in \\\\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\\\n          the speed of light.  but the formula for acceleration is \\\\n          acceleration = force / mass, (a = f/m).  orthodox physicists \\\\n          are ignoring the third factor: force.  in larson\\\\\\'s theory, \\\\n          mass stays constant and force drops toward zero.  force is \\\\n          actually a motion, or combinations of motions, or relations \\\\n          between motions, including inward and outward scalar motions.  \\\\n          the expansion of the universe, for example, is an outward \\\\n          scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of \\\\n          the so-called \"big bang\" (which is yet another mathematical \\\\n          fantasy). \\\\n    \\\\n                                    \\\\n          \\\\n          the universe of motion\\\\n\\\\n               i wish to recommend to everyone the book \"the universe \\\\n          of motion\", by dewey b. larson, 1984, north pacific \\\\n          publishers, (p.o. box 13255, portland, oregon  97213), 456 \\\\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\\\n    \\\\n               it contains the astrophysical portions of a general \\\\n          unified theory of the physical universe developed by that \\\\n          author, an unrecognized genius, more than thirty years ago. \\\\n    \\\\n               it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical \\\\n          mysteries, including the formation of galaxies, binary and \\\\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the true origin of \\\\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\\\n          ray bursts, and the true nature of quasars, pulsars, white \\\\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\\\n    \\\\n               it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all \\\\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\\\n          open minds! \\\\n    \\\\n               the following is an example of his theory\\\\\\'s success: \\\\n          in his first book in 1959, \"the structure of the physical \\\\n          universe\", larson predicted the existence of exploding \\\\n          galaxies, several years before astronomers started finding \\\\n          them.  they are a necessary consequence of larson\\\\\\'s \\\\n          comprehensive theory.  and when quasars were discovered, he \\\\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n          gamma-ray bursts\\\\n\\\\n               astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\\\n          their heads about the mysterious gamma-ray bursts.  they were \\\\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\\\n          disc of our galaxy.  but the new gamma ray telescope now in \\\\n          earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\\\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do not \\\\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\\\n          directional coincidence). \\\\n    \\\\n               gamma-ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the \\\\n          general unified theory of the physical universe developed by \\\\n          the late physicist dewey b. larson.  according to page 386 of \\\\n          his book \"the universe of motion\", published in 1984, the \\\\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the \\\\n          anti-matter half of the physical universe, which larson calls \\\\n          the \"cosmic sector\".  because of the relationship between the \\\\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\\\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\\\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\\\n          random.  (this is why the source locations of the bursts do \\\\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\\\n          directions uniformly.) \\\\n    \\\\n               i wonder how close to us in space a source location \\\\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\\\n          life on earth!  there would be no way to predict one, nor to \\\\n          stop it! \\\\n    \\\\n               perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past, which \\\\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\\\n          actually caused by nearby gamma-ray bursts! \\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          larsonian binary star formation\\\\n          \\\\n               about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\\\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  but orthodox \\\\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\\\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\\\n    \\\\n               but binary star systems are actually a likely \\\\n          consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of \\\\n          the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey \\\\n          b. larson. \\\\n    \\\\n               i will try to summarize larsons explanation, which is \\\\n          detailed in chapter 7 of his book \"the universe of motion\" \\\\n          and in some of his other books. \\\\n    \\\\n               first of all, according to larson, stars do not generate \\\\n          energy by \"fusion\".  a small fraction comes from slow \\\\n          gravitational collapse.  the rest results from the complete \\\\n          annihilation of heavy elements (heavier than iron).  each \\\\n          element has a destructive temperature limit.  the heavier the \\\\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  a star\\\\\\'s internal \\\\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\\\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\\\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\\\n          lighter elements. \\\\n    \\\\n               when the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\\\n          destructive temperature limit of iron, there is a type i \\\\n          supernova explosion!  this is because there is so much iron \\\\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\\\n          and the atom building process, which larson explains in some \\\\n          of his books [better than i can]. \\\\n    \\\\n               when the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\\\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\\\n          than the speed of light.  the heavier material in the center \\\\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\\\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  the \\\\n          explosion pushes that material over the speed of light, and \\\\n          it expands outward in time, which is equivalent to inward in \\\\n          space, and it often actually disappears for a while. \\\\n    \\\\n               over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\\\n          back gravitationally.  the material that had been blown \\\\n          outward in space now starts to form a red giant star.  the \\\\n          material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a \\\\n          white dwarf star.  both stars then start moving back toward \\\\n          the \"main sequence\" from opposite directions on the h-r \\\\n          diagram. \\\\n    \\\\n               the chances of the two masses falling back into the \\\\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\\\n          again, are near zero.  they will instead form a binary \\\\n          system, orbiting each other. \\\\n     \\\\n               according to larson, a white dwarf star has an inverse \\\\n          density gradient (is densest at its surface), because the \\\\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\\\n          outward) in time.   this eliminates the need to resort to \\\\n          mathematical fantasies about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\\\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\\\n    \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          larsonian solar system formation\\\\n\\\\n               if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\\\n          exploding star is relatively small, then, instead of a single \\\\n          white dwarf star, there will be several \"mini\" white dwarf \\\\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\\\n          still too far away in three-dimensional time to be affected \\\\n          by its heat, etc.).  these will become planets! \\\\n      \\\\n               in chapter 7 of the universe of motion, larson used all \\\\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\\\n          general unified theory of the physical universe, to derive \\\\n          his own version of bode\\\\\\'s law. \\\\n          \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          \"black hole\" fantasy!\\\\n\\\\n               i heard that physicist stephen w. hawking recently \\\\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two \"black \\\\n          holes\" merging together into a single \"black hole\", and \\\\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have more mass than \\\\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\\\n    \\\\n               such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red \\\\n          flag, causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of \"black \\\\n          holes\", etc.! \\\\n    \\\\n               after reading physicist dewey b. larson\\\\\\'s books about \\\\n          his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical \\\\n          universe, especially his book \"the universe of motion\", it is \\\\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are nothing more than \\\\n          mathematical fantasies!  the strange object at cygnus x-1 is \\\\n          just an unusually massive white dwarf star, not the \"black \\\\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\\\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\\\n    \\\\n    \\\\n               by the way, i do not understand why so much publicity is \\\\n          being given to physicist stephen hawking.  the physicists and \\\\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking\\\\\\'s severe physical \\\\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  it does not! \\\\n    \\\\n               i wish the same attention had been given to physicist \\\\n          dewey b. larson while he was still alive.  widespread \\\\n          publicity and attention should now be given to larson\\\\\\'s \\\\n          theory, books, and organization (the international society of \\\\n          unified science). \\\\n          \\\\n          \\\\n          \\\\n          electro-magnetic propulsion\\\\n\\\\n               i heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\\\n          with ufo\\\\\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but i never was able to \\\\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\\\n    \\\\n               i found a possible clue about why they might work on \\\\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"basic properties of matter\", by \\\\n          the late physicist dewey b. larson, which describes part of \\\\n          larson\\\\\\'s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical \\\\n          universe.  i quote one paragraph: \\\\n    \\\\n               \"as indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\\\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\\\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\\\n          the electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  it \\\\n          was brought out in volume i [larson\\\\\\'s book \"nothing but \\\\n          motion\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\\\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\\\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\\\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\\\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\\\n          limited.  it follows that there is always a large excess of \\\\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\\\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  in this uncharged \\\\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\\\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\\\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  in open \\\\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\\\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\\\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  in the context of the \\\\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\\\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\\\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  all \\\\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\\\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\\\n          meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\\\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  the \\\\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\\\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\\\n          \\\\n               note that in larson\\\\\\'s theory, uncharged electrons are \\\\n          also massless, and are basically photons of light of a \\\\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\\\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\\\n          (\"unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\\\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\\\n          according to larson\\\\\\'s theory.)  [i might have the \"above\" and \\\\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\\\n    \\\\n               larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\\\n          less un-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\\\n          light! \\\\n    \\\\n               if this is true, then the electro-magnetic propulsion \\\\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\\\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps giving them a \\\\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\\\n          achieve propulsion. (in larson\\\\\\'s theory, an electrical charge \\\\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\\\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\\\n          rotation of the particle.) \\\\n      \\\\n               the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\\\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\\\n          generated in clouds. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          suppression of larsonian physics\\\\n\\\\n               the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical \\\\n          universe developed by the late physicist dewey b. larson has \\\\n          been available for more than 30 years, published in 1959 in \\\\n          his first book \"the structure of the physical universe\". \\\\n    \\\\n               it is totally un-scientific for hawking, wheeler, sagan, \\\\n          and the other sacred priests of the religion they call \\\\n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \\\\n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \\\\n          totally ignore larson\\\\\\'s theory has they have. \\\\n    \\\\n               larson\\\\\\'s theory has excellent explanations for many \\\\n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \\\\n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \\\\n    \\\\n               larson\\\\\\'s theory deserves to be honestly and openly \\\\n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \\\\n          in

usual in space.  the nineties and\\\\nthe double-oughts will look just like the seventies and eighties, a\\\\nprospect too depressing to bear.\\\\n\\\\n(pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different\\\\ndirection.  it doesn\\\\\\'t lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital\\\\nlaunch for under ten megabucks.  it\\\\\\'s creating its own market for\\\\nsmall payloads.)\\\\n\\\\ni read the magazines and i\\\\\\'ve attended the last two iafs. there are\\\\nplenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some\\\\nof them as good as or better than ssto.  there is no sign in today\\\\\\'s\\\\nworld that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an\\\\nassembly line.\\\\n\\\\n>you could change my view on dc-x if you could prove the following:\\\\n[...deleting some things i\\\\\\'m not going to prove tonight...]\\\\n>3  that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a man-ratable\\\\n>dc-x successor\\\\n\\\\nstrawman.  is anybody seriously proposing this?  references, please. \\\\nthe dc must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which\\\\nincludes a nasa ferociously committed to continuing shuttle\\\\noperations, as well as the \"bird in the hand\" argument your common\\\\nsense tells you.   if dc-y flies at all, it flies alongside the\\\\nshuttle, not instead of it.\\\\n\\\\nalso, of course, dc-y and its operational descendants will be useful\\\\nfor a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.\\\\n\\\\n>4  most importantly, that the dc-x will open up leo to more scientific and\\\\n>technical payloads.\\\\n\\\\nif a dc-x successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1m, or even $5m,\\\\nrather than the $40m it now costs, more people will be able to afford\\\\nmore payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites\\\\ninstead of one.  big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  little\\\\noutfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of\\\\nbegging a ride.  this is just supply and demand.  you should be able\\\\nto convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming dc makes a\\\\nbig difference in costs.  do you have some reason to think not?\\\\n\\\\n     o~~*           /_) \\\\\\' / /   /_/ \\\\\\'  ,   ,  \\\\\\' ,_  _           \\\\\\\\|/\\\\n   - ~ -~~~~~~~~~~~/_) / / /   / /

detonate devices with somewhere from one to\\\\nten megatons yield behind a \"pusher plate\" attached to the main\\\\nspacecraft.  the shock wave from the explosions would transfer\\\\nmomentum to the ship.\\\\n\\\\n  now, in an atmosphere i can see this.  the energy of the explosion\\\\nheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave\\\\ninto the pusher plate.  but in a vacuum, only two things i can see are\\\\ngoing to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,\\\\nhelium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic\\\\nradiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission\\\\nproducts).\\\\n\\\\n  would this work?  i can\\\\\\'t see the em radiation impelling very much\\\\nmomentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems\\\\nto me you\\\\\\'re going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs\\\\nout the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once\\\\nthey\\\\\\'re

provided\\\\na testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s\". this\\\\nsummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300\\\\nparticipants at the conference on olympus utilisation held in\\\\nseville on 20-22-april 1993. the conference was organised by\\\\nthe european space agency (esa) and the spanish centre for\\\\nthe development of industrial technology (cdti).\\\\n\\\\nolympus has been particularly useful :\\\\n-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of\\\\n       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small\\\\n       antennas (vsats). olympus experiments have tested\\\\n       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,\\\\n       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few\\\\n       examples.\\\\n\\\\n-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services\\\\n       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-\\\\n       frequency bands; olympus was the first satellite over\\\\n       europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 ghz band.\\\\n\\\\n-      in establishing two-way data relay links  olympus\\\\n       received for the first time in europe, over several months,\\\\n       high-volume data from a low-earth orbiting spacecraft and\\\\n       then distributed it to various centres in europe.\\\\n\\\\nwhen olympus was launched on 12 july 1989 it was the\\\\nworld\\\\\\'s largest telecommunications satellite; and no other\\\\nsatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four\\\\ndifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.\\\\n\\\\nolympus users range from individual experimenters to some\\\\nof the world\\\\\\'s largest businesses. access to the satellite is\\\\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\\\\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\\\\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\\\\n100 members of the eurostep distance-learning\\\\norganisation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nas the new technologies and services tested by these\\\\nolympus users enter the commercial market, they then\\\\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\\\\neutelsat.\\\\n\\\\nolympus utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994,\\\\nwhen the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the\\\\nend of its design

zogeheten\\\\n\\\\\\'compacte objecten\\\\\\', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\\\\nbij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\\\\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\\\\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. in de\\\\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. lamers een\\\\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware

environment is being constructed on which to test\\\\ntele-operated models. these models are remotely-controlled by individuals\\\\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for edutainment\\\\npurposes.\\\\nnot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\\\\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\\\\ninformation\\\\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\\\\na\\\\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\\\\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\\\\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\\\\ntwenty-first century remote learning methods.\\\\n \\\\nbecause of the nature of the ltm1 project, people of all ages, interests\\\\nand\\\\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\\\\ninterfacing\\\\nand electronics, software and graphics. in operation ltm1 is an evolving\\\\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\\\\nprofessionals worldwide. using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\\\\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\\\\nthe\\\\nltm1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. because a real\\\\nfacility\\\\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\\\\nconstruction\\\\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\\\\nby the users themselves.\\\\n \\\\nthis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\\\\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\\\\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\\\\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\\\\n - art and theater\\\\n - bbs and online network users\\\\n - software and game developers\\\\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\\\\n - children\\\\n - the child in all of us\\\\n \\\\nltm1 overall design:\\\\n \\\\na room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. the walls are used\\\\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\\\\nthe \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. a global call for contributions\\\\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\\\\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\\\\nmachine-lets.\\\\n \\\\n the ltm1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\\\\n 1. an ssto scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\\\\n 2. a bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\\\\n 3. a moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\\\\n \\\\n each machinelet has a small tv camera utilizing a ccd tv chip mounted on\\\\n it. a personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\\\\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\\\\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\\\\n \\\\nthe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\\\\nwith tv cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\\\\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. the user will\\\\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\\\\ndata link to ltm1.\\\\n \\\\nnext, an ssto scale model with a ccd tv chip will be suspended from a\\\\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\\\\nssto\\\\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\\\\nlandscape and land.\\\\n \\\\nfinally, some tank models will be modified to be ccd tv chip equipped\\\\nbulldozerlets. the entire initial ltm1 will allow remote operators\\\\nworldwide\\\\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\\\\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. the entire system is based on\\\\ncommercially\\\\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\\\\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\\\\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\\\\n \\\\nby taking a graphically oriented communications program (dmodem) and adding\\\\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\\\\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\\\\n \\\\nplan of action:\\\\n \\\\nthe diaspar virtual reality network has agreed to sponsor this project by\\\\nproviding a host computer network and internet access to that network.\\\\ndiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\\\\nof the lunar model. diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\\\\nmodified and one ccd tv chip. diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\\\\nfor the lunar train model. diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical\\\\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\\\\nan initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\\\\na live photo-session and news conference on april 30, 1993. the initial\\\\nmodels will be put in place. a time-lapse record will be started for\\\\nhistorical purposes. it is not expected that this event will be completely\\\\nserious or solemn. the lunar colony will be declared open for additional\\\\nbuilding, operations and experiments. a photographer will be present and\\\\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\\\\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\\\\\\'s. a press release will be\\\\nissued\\\\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\\\\nmodels\\\\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\\\\n \\\\na contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\\\\nbe\\\\nannounced. universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\\\\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\\\\nthe lunar colony model. field trips to ltm1 can be arranged and at that\\\\ntime\\\\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. contributors will\\\\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\\\\nto\\\\ntheir campus.\\\\n \\\\na monthly ltm1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\\\\nconventional means to the media. any major new tele-operated equipment\\\\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\\\\nhaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\\\\nopportunity for the television community. especially since the \"action\"\\\\nwill\\\\nbe controlled by people all over the world. science fiction writers will be\\\\ninvited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\\\\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\\\\nlunar tasks. using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\\\\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\\\\n \\\\nthe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\\\\nexperimentation\\\\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. ltm1 has the potential of being a\\\\nlong\\\\nterm global edutainment method for space activities and may be the generic\\\\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\\\\nto space edutainment. all of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\\\\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\\\\n \\\\nconclusion:\\\\n \\\\nedutainment is the blending of education and entertainment. anyone who has\\\\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\\\\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\\\\npurposes. by creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\\\\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\\\\nreal\\\\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\\\\\\'s minds in\\\\nspace.\\\\n \\\\n

mondo aerobraking!].\\\\n\\\\n  he notes that the two recently discovered \"kuiper belt\" objects,\\\\n1992 qb1 and 1993 fw, plus chiron and pholus, are all about the same \\\\nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\\\\nlarger bodies of triton and pluto/charon.  pluto/charon, he thinks,\\\\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-pluto, knocking some material\\\\ninto a ring around pluto which later accreted in charon; similar to\\\\nideas about the formation of earth\\\\\\'s moon.  there is good evidence\\\\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of pluto and charon are very different\\\\n(pluto has methane frost, charon doesn\\\\\\'t), which can be used as evidence\\\\nfor the impact theory.\\\\n\\\\n  he believes that there may be around 1000 pluto-to-chiron-sized objects\\\\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside neptune\\\\\\'s \\\\norbit, beyond 35 au or so.  1992 qb1 and 1993 fw are the first members\\\\nof this population to be found, in his model.  note that such bodies\\\\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \\\\nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\\\\nby now.  the reason that pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, i think)\\\\nis that its surface warms up just enough around perihelion to sublimate,\\\\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\\\\nbright, new frost.  so any bodies much farther away than 30 au are going\\\\nto be very hard to see.\\\\n\\\\n  i hope i haven\\\\\\'t made any errors in the transcription; if you see\\\\na howling mistake, it\\\\\\'s undoubtedly mine, not his.\\\\n\\\\n  by the way, he\\\\\\'s one of the top guns behind the pluto fast flyby\\\\nmission (i think), and said that the current plans are to use a\\\\ntitan 4 to send the probe on \"just about a rectilinear trajectory\"\\\\nto pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  he\\\\\\'d like\\\\nto use a proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs\\\\nmuch less.  his figures: $500 million for 2 titan 4 launches (there\\\\nwill be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 million\\\\nfor 2 proton launches.  he told a story about how the soviets originally\\\\noffered to sell proton launches for $30 million each, but were forced\\\\nto increase their prices in the us in order to be allowed in the\\\\nmarketplace.\\\\n\\\\n  i\\\\\\'m just telling you what he said.\\\\n\\\\n                          michael\\\\n\\\\n-- \\\\n-----                                                    michael richmond\\\\n\"this is the heart that broke my finger.\"    richmond@astro.princeton.edu\\\\n\\\\n\\', \\'from: msb@sq.sq.com (mark brader)\\\\nsubject: re: comet in temporary orbit around jupiter?\\\\norganization: softquad inc., toronto, canada\\\\nlines: 20\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n> > > also, peri[jove]s of gehrels3 were:\\\\n> > > \\\\n> > > april  1973     83 jupiter radii\\\\n> > > august 1970     ~3 jupiter radii\\\\n\\\\n> > where 1 jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 au. ...\\\\n\\\\n> sorry, _perijoves_...i\\\\\\'m not used to talking this language.\\\\n\\\\nthanks again.  one final question.  the name gehrels wasn\\\\\\'t known to\\\\nme before this thread came up, but the may issue of scientific american\\\\nhas an article about the \"inconstant cosmos\", with a photo of neil\\\\ngehrels, project scientist for nasa\\\\\\'s compton gamma ray observatory.\\\\nsame person?\\\\n-- \\\\nmark brader, softquad inc., toronto\\\\t\"information! ... we want information!\"\\\\nutzoo!sq!msb, msb@sq.com\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t-- the prisoner\\\\n\\\\nthis article is in the public domain.\\\\n\\', \"from: clj@ksr.com (chris jones)\\\\nsubject: re: keeping spacecraft on after funding cuts.\\\\nreply-to: clj@ksr.com (chris jones)\\\\norganization: kendall square research corp\\\\nlines: 13\\\\nin-reply-to: prb@access.digex.com (pat)\\\\n\\\\nin article <1r6aqr$dnv@access.digex.net>, prb@access (pat) writes:\\\\n>voyager  has the unusual  luck to be on a stable trajectory out of the\\\\n>solar system.   all it\\'s doing is collecting  fields  data,  and routinely\\\\n>squirting it down.  one of the mariners is also in stable\\\\n>solar orbit,  and still providing similiar  solar data.  \\\\n\\\\nthere are no mariner craft from which we are still receiving data.  i believe\\\\nyou are referring to one or more of pioneers 6 through 9 (launched from\\\\ndecember 1965 through november 1968), which were put into solar orbits to study\\\\ninterplanetary space.  i recall reading that at least one of them was still\\\\nfunctioning 25 years after launch.\\\\n--\\\\nchris jones    clj@ksr.com\\\\n\", \\'from: baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov (ron baalke)\\\\nsubject: mars observer update -

mission sts-61 to\\\\nservice the hubble space telescope (hst) has been scheduled as an 11 day\\\\nmission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability\\\\nfor an additional two, if needed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tthe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or evas, was\\\\nreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times\\\\nrequired using the shuttle\\\\\\'s robot arm based on software simulations and actual\\\\neva tasks on previous missions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\"basically what we\\\\\\'ve done by going to five evas rather than three is\\\\nto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the\\\\ndynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\" mission director randy brinkley said.\\\\n\"it improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added\\\\nflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tin laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the\\\\nspacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays\\\\nand the wide field/planetary camera (wf/pc) and installing the corrective\\\\noptics space telescope axial replacement (costar) are priority objectives\\\\nduring the mission.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\"when we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through\\\\nlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,\\\\nwf/pc and costar -- would consume most of the time set aside for each\\\\nspacewalk, five evas were deemed appropriate,\" said milt heflin, lead flight\\\\ndirector for the mission.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\twhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two\\\\nalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than\\\\nprevious missions requiring two, three or four evas.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\"we have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous\\\\nspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five evas,\"\\\\nheflin said.  \"in planning for all space shuttle missions, it is necessary to\\\\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\\\\nto accomplish the mission objectives.\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tplanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\\\\nthat include support from the mission control center, called joint integrated\\\\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  in addition, many stand alone\\\\nunderwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tvarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\\\\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\\\\nmission.  also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\\\\nwill be valuable in assisting the sts-61 crew in its training techniques.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tendeavour\\\\\\'s june flight and discovery\\\\\\'s july mission both will include\\\\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the hst mission.\\\\nthe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\\\\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\\\\nthe johnson space center, houston, and the marshall space flight center,\\\\nhuntsville, ala.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\talso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\\\\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\\\\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\\\\ntrainers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tdesigned to be serviced by a space shuttle crew, hubble was built with\\\\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\tthe telescope was launched aboard discovery in april 1990.  at that\\\\ntime the nasa mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to hst in\\\\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\\\\nbecome necessary.\\\\n\\\\n- end -\\\\n     ___    _____     ___\\\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\\\\\  /_ /|     ron baalke         |

hopes this single-stage rocket technology\\\\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (ssto)\\\\nrocket ship.\\\\n\\\\n        the white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the white sands\\\\nmissile range in new mexico this week.  flight tests will start in\\\\nmid-june.\\\\n\\\\n        although there wasn\\\\\\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\\\\nssto research remains cloudy.  the sdi organization -- which paid $60\\\\nmillion for the dc-x -- can\\\\\\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\\\\nfollow-on vehicle.  to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\\\\na sub-orbital dc-xa, sdio is passing a tin cup among its sister government\\\\nagencies.\\\\n\\\\n        sdio originally funded ssto research as a way to cut the costs for\\\\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  however, recent\\\\nchanges in sdi\\\\\\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made ssto\\\\nless of a priority.  today, the agency is more interested in using dc-x as\\\\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\\\\n\\\\n        sdio has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\\\\nsaid col.  simon \"pete\" worden, sdio\\\\\\'s deputy for technology.  but worden\\\\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\\\\nprogram. \"i didn\\\\\\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money i\\\\nhave available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell\\\\ndouglas astronautics headquarters.\\\\n\\\\n        while sdio has lowered its sights on the program\\\\\\'s orbital\\\\nobjective, agency officials hail the dc-x as an example of the \"better,\\\\nfaster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  the agency believes\\\\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\\\\nevolutionary technology developments.\\\\n\\\\n        worden said the dc-x illustrates how a \"build a little, test a\\\\nlittle\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  he said\\\\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\\\\nshowed how today\\\\\\'s engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our\\\\nparents\\\\\\' time.\"\\\\n\\\\n        \"the key is management,\" worden said. \"sdio had a very light hand\\\\non this project.  we had only one overworked major, jess sponable.\"\\\\n\\\\n        although the next phase may involve more agencies, worden said\\\\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\\\\ncrucial. \"it\\\\\\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\\\\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially.\"\\\\n\\\\n        sdio\\\\\\'s approach also won praise from two

committee\\\\\\'s\\\\ndemocratic chairman. \"programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\\\\\\'t\\\\nsustainable....nasa hasn\\\\\\'t learned it yet.  sdio has.\"\\\\n\\\\n        rep.  dana rohrbacher, brown\\\\\\'s republican colleague, went further.\\\\njoking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a nasa design team,\"\\\\nrohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\\\\nwere left to the civil space agency.\\\\n\\\\n        rohrbacher, whose orange county district includes mcdonnell\\\\ndouglas, also criticized nasa-air force work on conventional, multi-staged\\\\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"let\\\\\\'s not\\\\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  let\\\\\\'s build a spaceship!\"\\\\n\\\\n         although rohrbacher praised sdio\\\\\\'s sponsorship, he said the\\\\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing ssto technology.\\\\n\\\\n        mcdonnell douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\\\\nc-17 transport and space station freedom programs, were more cautious\\\\nabout a large private secotro commitment. \"on very large ventures,\\\\ncompanies put in seed money,\" said charles ordahl, mcdonnell douglas\\\\\\'\\\\nsenior vice president for space systems. \"you need strong government\\\\ninvestments.\"\\\\n\\\\n        while the government and industry continue to differ on funding\\\\nfor the dc-xa, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\\\\ndevelopment.  citing corporate history, they liken the process to douglas\\\\naircraft\\\\\\'s dc aircraft.  just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\\\\nthe dc-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\\\\neventually lead to an orbital delta clipper (dc-1).\\\\n\\\\n        flight tests this summer at white sands will \"expand the envelope\"\\\\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  the\\\\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\\\\ntake-off and landing.  the second series will send the unmanned dc-x up to\\\\n5,000 feet.  the third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\\\\nfeet.\\\\n\\\\n        maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  the final\\\\ntests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back\\\\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\\\\n\\\\n        the flight test series will be supervised by charles \"pete\"\\\\nconrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the apollo 12 moon landing.\\\\nnow a mcdonnell douglas vice president, conrad paised the vehicles\\\\naircraft-like approach to operations.  features include automated\\\\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\\\\n\\\\n        if the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\\\\nbecome a key consideration.  this engine would have more thrust than the\\\\npratt & whitney rl10a-5 engines used on the dc-x.  each motor uses liquid\\\\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\\\\nthrust\\\\n\\\\n        based on the engine used in centaur upper stages, the a-5 model\\\\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\\\\nthrottling capability.  it also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\\\\nturnaround.\\\\n\\\\n        worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\\\\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union.\\\\nthe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\\\\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\\\\n\\\\n        the mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  pratt has\\\\na technology agreement with npo energomash, the design bureau responsible\\\\nfor the tri-propellant and energia cryogenic engines.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\', \\'from: gallas2@marcus.its.rpi.edu (sean michael gallagher)\\\\nsubject: funding for

data purchase act by now. this bill, also known as the back to \\\\nthe moon bill, would authorize the u.s. \\\\ngovernment to purchase lunar science data from private \\\\nand non-profit vendors, selected on the basis of competitive bidding, with an \\\\naggregate cap on bid awards of $65 million. \\\\n        if you have a copy of the bill, and can\\'t or don\\'t want to go through \\\\nall of the legalese contained in all federal legislation,don\\'t both - you have \\\\na free resource to evaluate the bill for you. your local congressional office, \\\\nlisted in the phone book,is staffed by people who can forward a copy of the\\\\nbill to legal experts. simply ask them to do so, and to consider supporting\\\\nthe lunar resources data purchase act. \\\\n        if you do get feedback, negative or positive, from your congressional \\\\noffice, please forward it to: david anderman\\\\n3136 e. yorba linda blvd., apt g-14, fullerton, ca 92631,\\\\nor via e-mail to: david.anderman@ofa123.fidonet.org. \\\\n        another resource is your local chapter of the national space society. \\\\nmembers of the chapter will be happy to work with you to evaluate and support \\\\nthe back to the moon bill. for the address and telephone number of the nearest \\\\nchapter to you, please send e-mail, or check the latest issue of ad astra, in \\\\na library near you.\\\\n        finally, if you have requested, and not received, information about\\\\nthe back to the moon bill, please re-send your request. the database for the\\\\nbill was recently corrupted, and some information was lost. the authors of the \\\\nbill thank you for your patience.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n--- maximus 2.01wb\\\\n\"]'"
