## This project is designed around customer retention. There are 160,000 entries each with 100 attributes including whether the customer canceled thier subscription. A random forest machine learning algorithm was used to analyze the data.
## The goal was to maximize AUC when predicting whether a customer would cancel their subscription.
## In[5] has an html error due to the fact that attribute x77 has a $ in front of each entry. If this file is opened in the Jupyter Notebook, this error does not occur.
