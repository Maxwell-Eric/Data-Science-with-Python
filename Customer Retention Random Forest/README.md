## This project is designed around customer retention. 
There are 160,000 entries each with 100 unlabeled attributes including whether the customer canceled thier subscription. 

The goal was to maximize AUC when predicting whether a customer would cancel their subscription.

A random forest machine learning algorithm was used to analyze the data.

This was a class project on Kaggle, on which I scored the highest AUC.
